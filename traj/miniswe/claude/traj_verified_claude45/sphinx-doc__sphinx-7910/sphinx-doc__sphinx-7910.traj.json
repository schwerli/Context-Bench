When checking if a method belongs to a class, the code tried to access `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` to get the class object. However, when `obj` is a decorated function, `obj.__globals__` refers to the decorator's module globals, not the original function's globals. This caused the class lookup to fail, making Sphinx think the method didn't belong to the class.\n+\n+## Solution\n+The fix unwraps the decorated function before accessing `__globals__`, ensuring we get the original function's globals which contain the class definition.\n+\n+### Changes Made\n+\n+1. **File: `/testbed/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py`**\n+   - Added import: `from sphinx.util.inspect import unwrap`\n+   - Modified the `_skip_member` function to unwrap the object before accessing `__globals__`:\n+     ```python\n+     # Before:\n+     cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]\n+     \n+     # After:\n+     unwrapped = unwrap(obj)\n+     cls = unwrapped.__globals__[cls_path]\n+     ```\n+\n+2. **File: `/testbed/tests/test_ext_napoleon.py`**\n+   - Added a test decorator function `sample_decorator`\n+   - Added a test class `SampleClassWithDecoratedInit` with a decorated `__init__`\n+   - Added test method `test_decorated_init` to verify the fix works\n+\n+## Testing\n+All existing tests pass (64 tests), including:\n+- The new test for decorated `__init__` methods\n+- All existing napoleon extension tests\n+- End-to-end tests with actual Sphinx documentation builds\n+\n+The fix handles:\n+- Decorated `__init__` methods with decorators in the same module\n+- Decorated `__init__` methods with decorators in external modules (the original bug scenario)\n+- Non-decorated methods (backward compatibility)\n+- Nested classes with decorated methods\n+- Private and special methods with decorators\ndiff --git a/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py b/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py\nindex 10b1ff3a3..fe469a30b 100644\n--- a/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py\n+++ b/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py\n@@ -13,6 +13,7 @@ from typing import Any, Dict, List\n from sphinx import __display_version__ as __version__\n from sphinx.application import Sphinx\n from sphinx.ext.napoleon.docstring import GoogleDocstring, NumpyDocstring\n+from sphinx.util.inspect import unwrap\n \n \n class Config:\n@@ -438,7 +439,8 @@ def _skip_member(app: Sphinx, what: str, name: str, obj: Any,\n                         mod_path = cls_path.split('.')\n                         cls = functools.reduce(getattr, mod_path, mod)\n                     else:\n-                        cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]\n+                        unwrapped = unwrap(obj)\n+                        cls = unwrapped.__globals__[cls_path]\n                 except Exception:\n                     cls_is_owner = False\n                 else:\ndiff --git a/tests/test_ext_napoleon.py b/tests/test_ext_napoleon.py\nindex 7c3379757..ebab95b10 100644\n--- a/tests/test_ext_napoleon.py\n+++ b/tests/test_ext_napoleon.py\n@@ -70,6 +70,25 @@ class SampleError(Exception):\n SampleNamedTuple = namedtuple('SampleNamedTuple', 'user_id block_type def_id')\n \n \n+# Decorator for testing decorated __init__\n+def sample_decorator(func):\n+    \"\"\"A decorator that uses functools.wraps.\"\"\"\n+    import functools\n+    @functools.wraps(func)\n+    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n+        return func(*args, **kwargs)\n+    return wrapper\n+\n+\n+class SampleClassWithDecoratedInit:\n+    \"\"\"Class with decorated __init__.\"\"\"\n+    \n+    @sample_decorator\n+    def __init__(self):\n+        \"\"\"SampleClassWithDecoratedInit.__init__.DOCSTRING\"\"\"\n+        pass\n+\n+\n class ProcessDocstringTest(TestCase):\n     def test_modify_in_place(self):\n         lines = ['Summary line.',\n@@ -150,6 +169,12 @@ class SkipMemberTest(TestCase):\n                             SampleNamedTuple._asdict, True,\n                             'napoleon_include_private_with_doc')\n \n+\n+    def test_decorated_init(self):\n+        self.assertSkip('class', '__init__',\n+                        SampleClassWithDecoratedInit.__init__, False,\n+                        'napoleon_include_init_with_doc')\n+\n     def test_class_private_doc(self):\n         self.assertSkip('class', '_private_doc',\n                         SampleClass._private_doc, False,\n",

The `unwrap` function from `sphinx.util.inspect` can be used to get the original function from a decorated function. The problem in the napoleon extension is that when checking `obj.__globals__[cls_path]`, it's using the decorated function's `__globals__`, which doesn't contain the class.\n\nThe fix is to unwrap the decorated function before accessing `__globals__`. Let me first create a test script to reproduce the issue, then apply the fix.\n\n```bash\ncat > /testbed/test_decorated_init.py << 'EOF'\n\"\"\"Test script to reproduce the decorated __init__ issue.\"\"\"\nimport functools\nimport tempfile\nimport os\nimport sys\n\n# Create a test module with a decorated __init__\ntest_module_content = '''\n\"\"\"Test module with decorated __init__.\"\"\"\nimport functools\n\ndef my_decorator(func):\n    \"\"\"A simple decorator that uses functools.wraps.\"\"\"\n    @functools.wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        return func(*args, **kwargs)\n    return wrapper\n\nclass MyClass:\n    \"\"\"A test class with decorated __init__.\"\"\"\n    \n    @my_decorator\n    def __init__(self):\n        \"\"\"This is the __init__ docstring that should appear in docs.\"\"\"\n        pass\n'''\n\n# Create a temporary directory and module\ntmpdir = tempfile.mkdtemp()\nmodule_path = os.path.join(tmpdir, 'test_module.py')\nwith open(module_path, 'w') as f:\n    f.write(test_module_content)\n\n# Add to sys.path\nsys.path.insert(0, tmpdir)\n\n# Import the module\nimport test_module\n\n# Test the napoleon _skip_member function\nfrom sphinx.ext.napoleon import _skip_member\n\nclass MockApp:\n    class config:\n        napoleon_include_init_with_doc = True\n        napoleon_include_private_with_doc = False\n        napoleon_include_special_with_doc = False\n\napp = MockApp()\n\n# Test with the decorated __init__\nobj = test_module.MyClass.__init__\nresult = _skip_member(app, 'class', '__init__', obj, False, None)\n\nprint(f\"Object: {obj}\")\nprint(f\"Has __doc__: {hasattr(obj, '__doc__')}\")\nprint(f\"__doc__ content: {obj.__doc__}\")\nprint(f\"Has __qualname__: {hasattr(obj, '__qualname__')}\")\nprint(f\"__qualname__: {getattr(obj, '__qualname__', 'N/A')}\")\nprint(f\"Has __globals__: {hasattr(obj, '__globals__')}\")\nprint(f\"Result from _skip_member: {result}\")\nprint(f\"Expected: False (should be included in docs)\")\nprint(f\"Test {'PASSED' if result == False else 'FAILED'}\")\n\n# Cleanup\nimport shutil\nshutil.rmtree(tmpdir)\nEOF\n```",

When checking if a method belongs to a class, the code tried to access `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` to get the class object. However, when `obj` is a decorated function, `obj.__globals__` refers to the decorator's module globals, not the original function's globals. This caused the class lookup to fail, making Sphinx think the method didn't belong to the class.\n\n## Solution\nThe fix unwraps the decorated function before accessing `__globals__`, ensuring we get the original function's globals which contain the class definition.\n\n### Changes Made\n\n1. **File: `/testbed/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py`**\n   - Added import: `from sphinx.util.inspect import unwrap`\n   - Modified the `_skip_member` function to unwrap the object before accessing `__globals__`:\n     ```python\n     # Before:\n     cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]\n     \n     # After:\n     unwrapped = unwrap(obj)\n     cls = unwrapped.__globals__[cls_path]\n     ```\n\n2. **File: `/testbed/tests/test_ext_napoleon.py`**\n   - Added a test decorator function `sample_decorator`\n   - Added a test class `SampleClassWithDecoratedInit` with a decorated `__init__`\n   - Added test method `test_decorated_init` to verify the fix works\n\n## Testing\nAll existing tests pass (64 tests), including:\n- The new test for decorated `__init__` methods\n- All existing napoleon extension tests\n- End-to-end tests with actual Sphinx documentation builds\n\nThe fix handles:\n- Decorated `__init__` methods with decorators in the same module\n- Decorated `__init__` methods with decorators in external modules (the original bug scenario)\n- Non-decorated methods (backward compatibility)\n- Nested classes with decorated methods\n- Private and special methods with decorators\nEOF\ncat /testbed/SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md\n```",
