Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in the current working directory (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1.

Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.ext\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.ext | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.ext\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.ext\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.ext | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.ext | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Multi-SWE-bench Specific Notes\n- You are working in a Multi-SWE-bench environment with multi-language repositories\n- The project may be in a subdirectory (e.g., /home/repo-name/)\n- Git repository is typically located in the project subdirectory\n- When working with Git operations, ensure you're in the correct repository directory\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.ext | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && (git status >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (cd */. 2>/dev/null && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (find . -name '.git' -type d -exec sh -c 'cd \"$(dirname \"{}\")\" && git add -A && git diff --cached' \\; 2>/dev/null | head -n 1000) || (echo \"Error: No git repository found\")\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

This isn't *just* a simple cherry-pick\r\nbecause the new tests in that branch use the v0.2.x module names, so\r\nthat had to be fixed. Otherwise, though, it's the same change, and I'll go\r\nahead and merge it when CI passes, since it was approved on `master`.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, using `#[instrument(err)]` on a function returning a `Result`\r\nwith an `impl Trait` in it results in a compiler error. This is because\r\nwe generate a type annotation on the closure in the function body that\r\ncontains the user function's actual body, and `impl Trait` isn't allowed\r\non types in local bindings, only on function parameters and return\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis branch fixes the issue by simply removing the return type\r\nannotation from the closure. I've also added tests that break on master\r\nfor functions returning `impl Trait`, both with and without the `err`\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nFixes #1227\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Eliza Weisman <eliza@buoyant.io>\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.

This is what needs to be removed.\n\nI will use `sed` to perform the replacement. The target line is `let #mutability #result_ident = (move || #ret {`. I will replace it with `let #mutability #result_ident = (move || {`. This removes the `#ret` token, which will remove the return type annotation from the generated closure.\n\nThis change is specific to the `err` case, which is where the closure is used. The non-`err` case doesn't use a closure and thus doesn't have this problem. This aligns with the PR description.\n\nI will now execute the `sed` command to apply the fix.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/let #mutability #result_ident = (move || #ret {/let #mutability #result_ident = (move || {/' tracing-attributes/src/lib.rs\n```",

The `sed` command I used was subtly wrong.\n\nLet's re-examine the `sed` command and the source code.\nThe command was: `sed -i 's/let #mutability #result_ident = (move || #ret {/let #mutability #result_ident = (move || {/' tracing/tracing-attributes/src/lib.rs`\n\nThe `#` character is not special for `sed` in this context. The spaces should be fine. It's possible that the original line in the file has some subtle differences from what I assumed.\n\nI need to look at the actual content of the file to be sure. I will dump the relevant part of the file to see what's actually there. I'll find the `instrument` function and look for the `err_arg` handling. I'll use `nl` and `sed` to view a range of lines. I'll start by searching for `err_arg` to find the relevant section.\n\n```bash\ngrep -n \"err_arg\" tracing/tracing-attributes/src/lib.rs\n```",
