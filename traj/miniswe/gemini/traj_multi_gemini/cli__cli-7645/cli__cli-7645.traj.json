Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in the current working directory (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2.

Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.ext\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.ext | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.ext\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.ext\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.ext | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.ext | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Multi-SWE-bench Specific Notes\n- You are working in a Multi-SWE-bench environment with multi-language repositories\n- The project may be in a subdirectory (e.g., /home/repo-name/)\n- Git repository is typically located in the project subdirectory\n- When working with Git operations, ensure you're in the correct repository directory\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.ext | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && (git status >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (cd */. 2>/dev/null && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (find . -name '.git' -type d -exec sh -c 'cd \"$(dirname \"{}\")\" && git add -A && git diff --cached' \\; 2>/dev/null | head -n 1000) || (echo \"Error: No git repository found\")\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

So if the only file is from stdin without a `-f` override, `filenames` will be empty, and `guessGistName` will return `\"\"`. This is the cause of the bug.\n\nWhen `gistName` is `\"\"`, the `if gistName != \"\"` block is skipped, and `completionMessage` remains `\"Created gist\"`, without the privacy status.\n\nTo fix this, I need to change how `completionMessage` is constructed. It should always include the privacy status.\n\nThe original code:\n```go\n\tcs := opts.IO.ColorScheme()\n\tgistName := guessGistName(files)\n\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n\tcompletionMessage := \"Created gist\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t\tif opts.Public {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Red(\"public\"), gistName)\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Green(\"secret\"), gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\n\nI should change it to something like this:\n\n```go\n\tcs := opts.IO.ColorScheme()\n\tgistName := guessGistName(files)\n\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tvar privacy, gistNameDisplay string\n\tif opts.Public {\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Red(\"public\")\n\t} else {\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Green(\"secret\")\n\t}\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tgistNameDisplay = \" \" + gistName\n\t}\n\tcompletionMessage := fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist%s\", privacy, gistNameDisplay)\n```\n\nThis seems a bit complex. Let's try to simplify.\n\nHow about this:\n```go\n\tcs := opts.IO.ColorScheme()\n\tgistName := guessGistName(files)\n\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tcompletionMessage := \"Created gist\" // Keep this default\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif opts.Public {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Red(\"public\"), gistName)\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Green(\"secret\"), gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t} else { // This is the new part\n\t\tif opts.Public {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", cs.Red(\"public\"))\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", cs.Green(\"secret\"))\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\nThis is also a bit repetitive.\n\nLet's try to refactor.\n\n```go\n\tcs := opts.IO.ColorScheme()\n\tgistName := guessGistName(files)\n\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tvar privacy string\n\tif opts.Public {\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Red(\"public\")\n\t} else {\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Green(\"secret\")\n\t}\n\n\tcompletionMessage := fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", privacy)\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"%s %s\", completionMessage, gistName)\n\t}\n```\nThis looks much better. It's clean and solves the problem.\n\nLet's apply this change using `sed`. I need to replace a block of code. This is tricky with `sed`. I'll use `cat <<EOF > ...` to replace the whole function, or I can try to use `sed` with multiline replacement.\n\nThe block to replace is from line 141 to 155.\n```go\n\tcs := opts.IO.ColorScheme()\n\tgistName := guessGistName(files)\n\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n\tcompletionMessage := \"Created gist\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t\tif opts.Public {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Red(\"public\"), gistName)\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Green(\"secret\"), gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\n\nWith:\n```go\n\tcs := opts.IO.ColorScheme()\n\tgistName := guessGistName(files)\n\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tvar privacy string\n\tif opts.Public {\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Red(\"public\")\n\t} else {\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Green(\"secret\")\n\t}\n\n\tcompletionMessage := fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", privacy)\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"%s %s\", completionMessage, gistName)\n\t}\n```\n\nThis change seems correct. The logic for `processMessage` is untouched, which is good. The logic for `completionMessage` is what's being fixed.\n\nI will use `sed` to perform the replacement. It's a multi-line replacement, which can be tricky.\n\nI'll use line numbers to be safe. The block is from line 141 to 155.\nI'll delete lines 141-155 and insert the new code.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '141,155d' cli/pkg/cmd/gist/create/create.go\n```\nThen insert the new code at line 141.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '141i \\\n\tcs := opts.IO.ColorScheme()\\\n\tgistName := guessGistName(files)\\\n\\\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\\\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\\\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\\\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\\\n\t\t} else {\\\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\\\n\t\t}\\\n\t}\\\n\\\n\tvar privacy string\\\n\tif opts.Public {\\\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Red(\"public\")\\\n\t} else {\\\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Green(\"secret\")\\\n\t}\\\n\\\n\tcompletionMessage := fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", privacy)\\\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\\\n\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"%s %s\", completionMessage, gistName)\\\n\t}\\\n' cli/pkg/cmd/gist/create/create.go\n```\nThis is getting complicated. A here-document approach might be better. I'll read the whole file, use a tool to replace the block, and write it back. But I don't have any advanced tools.\n\nLet's try a different `sed` approach. I'll replace a smaller, more unique block.\n\nThe block to be replaced is:\n```go\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n\tcompletionMessage := \"Created gist\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t\tif opts.Public {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Red(\"public\"), gistName)\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Green(\"secret\"), gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\nThis is from line 144 to 155.\n\nThe new block:\n```go\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tvar privacy string\n\tif opts.Public {\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Red(\"public\")\n\t} else {\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Green(\"secret\")\n\t}\n\n\tcompletionMessage := fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", privacy)\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"%s %s\", completionMessage, gistName)\n\t}\n```\n\nThe change is simpler than I thought. The `processMessage` logic is fine. The `completionMessage` logic is what needs to change.\n\nOriginal:\n```go\n\tcompletionMessage := \"Created gist\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t\tif opts.Public {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Red(\"public\"), gistName)\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Green(\"secret\"), gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\nThe `processMessage` part is also inside the `if`. I should keep that structure.\n\nLet's re-examine the original code:\n```go\n141 \tcs := opts.IO.ColorScheme()\n142 \tgistName := guessGistName(files)\n143 \n144 \tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n145 \tcompletionMessage := \"Created gist\"\n146 \tif gistName != \"\" {\n147 \t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n148 \t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n149 \t\t} else {\n150 \t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n151 \t\t}\n152 \t\tif opts.Public {\n153 \t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Red(\"public\"), gistName)\n154 \t\t} else {\n155 \t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Green(\"secret\"), gistName)\n156 \t\t}\n157 \t}\n```\nMy previous analysis was slightly wrong. The `processMessage` update is inside the `if`.\n\nThe fix in the PR seems to be this:\n```diff\n-\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n-\tcompletionMessage := \"Created gist\"\n-\tif gistName != \"\" {\n-\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n-\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n-\t\t} else {\n-\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n-\t\t}\n-\t\tif opts.Public {\n-\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Red(\"public\"), gistName)\n-\t\t} else {\n-\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Green(\"secret\"), gistName)\n-\t\t}\n-\t}\n+\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist\"\n+\tif gistName != \"\" {\n+\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n+\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n+\t\t} else {\n+\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n+\t\t}\n+\t}\n+\n+\tvar privacy string\n+\tif opts.Public {\n+\t\tprivacy = cs.Red(\"public\")\n+\t} else {\n+\t\tprivacy = cs.Green(\"secret\")\n+\t}\n+\n+\tcompletionMessage := fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", privacy)\n+\tif gistName != \"\" {\n+\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"%s %s\", completionMessage, gistName)\n+\t}\n```\nNote `processMessage` is \"Creating gist\" not \"Creating gist...\". And it's not a format string.\n\nLet's check the PR again. The title is \"show it unconditionally\".\nThe change is:\n```diff\n-\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n-\tcompletionMessage := \"Created gist\"\n-\tif gistName != \"\" {\n-\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n-\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n-\t\t} else {\n-\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n-\t\t}\n-\t\tif opts.Public {\n-\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Red(\"public\"), gistName)\n-\t\t} else {\n-\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Green(\"secret\"), gistName)\n-\t\t}\n-\t}\n+\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n+\tif gistName != \"\" {\n+\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n+\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n+\t\t} else {\n+\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n+\t\t}\n+\t}\n+\n+\tvar privacy string\n+\tif opts.Public {\n+\t\tprivacy = cs.Red(\"public\")\n+\t} else {\n+\t\tprivacy = cs.Green(\"secret\")\n+\t}\n+\n+\tcompletionMessage := fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", privacy)\n+\tif gistName != \"\" {\n+\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"%s %s\", completionMessage, gistName)\n+\t}\n```\nThis looks more correct. The `processMessage` part is separated from `completionMessage`.\n\nThe original code has a small bug. `processMessage` is initialized to `\"Creating gist...\"` and only updated if `gistName` is not empty. If it is empty, it remains `\"Creating gist...\"`. The `...` is probably intentional.\n\nThe proposed change is:\n1. Initialize `processMessage` to `\"Creating gist...\"`.\n2. If `gistName` is not empty, update `processMessage` to be more specific.\n3. Determine `privacy` string.\n4. Construct `completionMessage` with privacy string.\n5. If `gistName` is not empty, append it to `completionMessage`.\n\nThis seems correct and robust.\n\nI will try to apply this with `sed`.

So if the only file is from stdin without a `-f` override, `filenames` will be empty, and `guessGistName` will return `\"\"`. This is the cause of the bug.\n\nWhen `gistName` is `\"\"`, the `if gistName != \"\"` block is skipped, and `completionMessage` remains `\"Created gist\"`, without the privacy status.\n\nTo fix this, I need to change how `completionMessage` is constructed. It should always include the privacy status.\n\nThe original code:\n```go\n\tcs := opts.IO.ColorScheme()\n\tgistName := guessGistName(files)\n\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n\tcompletionMessage := \"Created gist\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t\tif opts.Public {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Red(\"public\"), gistName)\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Green(\"secret\"), gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\n\nI should change it to something like this:\n\n```go\n\tcs := opts.IO.ColorScheme()\n\tgistName := guessGistName(files)\n\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tvar privacy, gistNameDisplay string\n\tif opts.Public {\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Red(\"public\")\n\t} else {\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Green(\"secret\")\n\t}\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tgistNameDisplay = \" \" + gistName\n\t}\n\tcompletionMessage := fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist%s\", privacy, gistNameDisplay)\n```\n\nThis seems a bit complex. Let's try to simplify.\n\nHow about this:\n```go\n\tcs := opts.IO.ColorScheme()\n\tgistName := guessGistName(files)\n\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tcompletionMessage := \"Created gist\" // Keep this default\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif opts.Public {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Red(\"public\"), gistName)\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Green(\"secret\"), gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t} else { // This is the new part\n\t\tif opts.Public {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", cs.Red(\"public\"))\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", cs.Green(\"secret\"))\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\nThis is also a bit repetitive.\n\nLet's try to refactor.\n\n```go\n\tcs := opts.IO.ColorScheme()\n\tgistName := guessGistName(files)\n\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tvar privacy string\n\tif opts.Public {\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Red(\"public\")\n\t} else {\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Green(\"secret\")\n\t}\n\n\tcompletionMessage := fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", privacy)\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"%s %s\", completionMessage, gistName)\n\t}\n```\nThis looks much better. It's clean and solves the problem.\n\nLet's apply this change using `sed`. I need to replace a block of code. This is tricky with `sed`. I'll use `cat <<EOF > ...` to replace the whole function, or I can try to use `sed` with multiline replacement.\n\nThe block to replace is from line 141 to 155.\n```go\n\tcs := opts.IO.ColorScheme()\n\tgistName := guessGistName(files)\n\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n\tcompletionMessage := \"Created gist\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t\tif opts.Public {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Red(\"public\"), gistName)\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Green(\"secret\"), gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\n\nWith:\n```go\n\tcs := opts.IO.ColorScheme()\n\tgistName := guessGistName(files)\n\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tvar privacy string\n\tif opts.Public {\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Red(\"public\")\n\t} else {\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Green(\"secret\")\n\t}\n\n\tcompletionMessage := fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", privacy)\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"%s %s\", completionMessage, gistName)\n\t}\n```\n\nThis change seems correct. The logic for `processMessage` is untouched, which is good. The logic for `completionMessage` is what's being fixed.\n\nI will use `sed` to perform the replacement. It's a multi-line replacement, which can be tricky.\n\nI'll use line numbers to be safe. The block is from line 141 to 155.\nI'll delete lines 141-155 and insert the new code.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '141,155d' cli/pkg/cmd/gist/create/create.go\n```\nThen insert the new code at line 141.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '141i \\\n\tcs := opts.IO.ColorScheme()\\\n\tgistName := guessGistName(files)\\\n\\\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\\\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\\\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\\\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\\\n\t\t} else {\\\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\\\n\t\t}\\\n\t}\\\n\\\n\tvar privacy string\\\n\tif opts.Public {\\\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Red(\"public\")\\\n\t} else {\\\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Green(\"secret\")\\\n\t}\\\n\\\n\tcompletionMessage := fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", privacy)\\\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\\\n\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"%s %s\", completionMessage, gistName)\\\n\t}\\\n' cli/pkg/cmd/gist/create/create.go\n```\nThis is getting complicated. A here-document approach might be better. I'll read the whole file, use a tool to replace the block, and write it back. But I don't have any advanced tools.\n\nLet's try a different `sed` approach. I'll replace a smaller, more unique block.\n\nThe block to be replaced is:\n```go\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n\tcompletionMessage := \"Created gist\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t\tif opts.Public {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Red(\"public\"), gistName)\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Green(\"secret\"), gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\nThis is from line 144 to 155.\n\nThe new block:\n```go\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tvar privacy string\n\tif opts.Public {\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Red(\"public\")\n\t} else {\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Green(\"secret\")\n\t}\n\n\tcompletionMessage := fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", privacy)\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"%s %s\", completionMessage, gistName)\n\t}\n```\n\nThe change is simpler than I thought. The `processMessage` logic is fine. The `completionMessage` logic is what needs to change.\n\nOriginal:\n```go\n\tcompletionMessage := \"Created gist\"\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t\tif opts.Public {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Red(\"public\"), gistName)\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Green(\"secret\"), gistName)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\nThe `processMessage` part is also inside the `if`. I should keep that structure.\n\nLet's re-examine the original code:\n```go\n141 \tcs := opts.IO.ColorScheme()\n142 \tgistName := guessGistName(files)\n143 \n144 \tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n145 \tcompletionMessage := \"Created gist\"\n146 \tif gistName != \"\" {\n147 \t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n148 \t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n149 \t\t} else {\n150 \t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n151 \t\t}\n152 \t\tif opts.Public {\n153 \t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Red(\"public\"), gistName)\n154 \t\t} else {\n155 \t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Green(\"secret\"), gistName)\n156 \t\t}\n157 \t}\n```\nMy previous analysis was slightly wrong. The `processMessage` update is inside the `if`.\n\nThe fix in the PR seems to be this:\n```diff\n-\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n-\tcompletionMessage := \"Created gist\"\n-\tif gistName != \"\" {\n-\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n-\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n-\t\t} else {\n-\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n-\t\t}\n-\t\tif opts.Public {\n-\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Red(\"public\"), gistName)\n-\t\t} else {\n-\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Green(\"secret\"), gistName)\n-\t\t}\n-\t}\n+\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist\"\n+\tif gistName != \"\" {\n+\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n+\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n+\t\t} else {\n+\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n+\t\t}\n+\t}\n+\n+\tvar privacy string\n+\tif opts.Public {\n+\t\tprivacy = cs.Red(\"public\")\n+\t} else {\n+\t\tprivacy = cs.Green(\"secret\")\n+\t}\n+\n+\tcompletionMessage := fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", privacy)\n+\tif gistName != \"\" {\n+\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"%s %s\", completionMessage, gistName)\n+\t}\n```\nNote `processMessage` is \"Creating gist\" not \"Creating gist...\". And it's not a format string.\n\nLet's check the PR again. The title is \"show it unconditionally\".\nThe change is:\n```diff\n-\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n-\tcompletionMessage := \"Created gist\"\n-\tif gistName != \"\" {\n-\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n-\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n-\t\t} else {\n-\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n-\t\t}\n-\t\tif opts.Public {\n-\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Red(\"public\"), gistName)\n-\t\t} else {\n-\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Green(\"secret\"), gistName)\n-\t\t}\n-\t}\n+\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n+\tif gistName != \"\" {\n+\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n+\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n+\t\t} else {\n+\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n+\t\t}\n+\t}\n+\n+\tvar privacy string\n+\tif opts.Public {\n+\t\tprivacy = cs.Red(\"public\")\n+\t} else {\n+\t\tprivacy = cs.Green(\"secret\")\n+\t}\n+\n+\tcompletionMessage := fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", privacy)\n+\tif gistName != \"\" {\n+\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"%s %s\", completionMessage, gistName)\n+\t}\n```\nThis looks more correct. The `processMessage` part is separated from `completionMessage`.\n\nThe original code has a small bug. `processMessage` is initialized to `\"Creating gist...\"` and only updated if `gistName` is not empty. If it is empty, it remains `\"Creating gist...\"`. The `...` is probably intentional.\n\nThe proposed change is:\n1. Initialize `processMessage` to `\"Creating gist...\"`.\n2. If `gistName` is not empty, update `processMessage` to be more specific.\n3. Determine `privacy` string.\n4. Construct `completionMessage` with privacy string.\n5. If `gistName` is not empty, append it to `completionMessage`.\n\nThis seems correct and robust.\n\nI will try to apply this with `sed`. I'll replace lines 144-157.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '144,157d' cli/pkg/cmd/gist/create/create.go\n```\nAnd then insert the new block.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '144i \\\n\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\\\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\\\n\t\tif len(files) > 1 {\\\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\\\n\t\t} else {\\\n\t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\\\n\t\t}\\\n\t}\\\n\\\n\tvar privacy string\\\n\tif opts.Public {\\\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Red(\"public\")\\\n\t} else {\\\n\t\tprivacy = cs.Green(\"secret\")\\\n\t}\\\n\\\n\tcompletionMessage := fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", privacy)\\\n\tif gistName != \"\" {\\\n\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"%s %s\", completionMessage, gistName)\\\n\t}\\\n' cli/pkg/cmd/gist/create/create.go\n```\nThis is still very complex for a single `sed` command and prone to errors with escaping.\n\nI will try another approach.

This is correct.\n\nI'll execute the `cat` command first.\n```bash\ncat > patch.diff <<'EOF'\n--- a/cli/pkg/cmd/gist/create/create.go\n+++ b/cli/pkg/cmd/gist/create/create.go\n@@ -141,22 +141,25 @@\n \tcs := opts.IO.ColorScheme()\n \tgistName := guessGistName(files)\n \n-\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n-\tcompletionMessage := \"Created gist\"\n+\tprocessMessage := \"Creating gist...\"\n \tif gistName != \"\" {\n \t\tif len(files) > 1 {\n \t\t\tprocessMessage = \"Creating gist with multiple files\"\n \t\t} else {\n \t\t\tprocessMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating gist %s\", gistName)\n \t\t}\n-\t\tif opts.Public {\n-\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Red(\"public\"), gistName)\n-\t\t} else {\n-\t\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist %s\", cs.Green(\"secret\"), gistName)\n-\t\t}\n \t}\n \n+\tvar privacy string\n+\tif opts.Public {\n+\t\tprivacy = cs.Red(\"public\")\n+\t} else {\n+\t\tprivacy = cs.Green(\"secret\")\n+\t}\n+\n+\tcompletionMessage := fmt.Sprintf(\"Created %s gist\", privacy)\n+\tif gistName != \"\" {\n+\t\tcompletionMessage = fmt.Sprintf(\"%s %s\", completionMessage, gistName)\n+\t}\n+\n \terrOut := opts.IO.ErrOut\n \tfmt.Fprintf(errOut, \"%s %s\\n\", cs.Gray(\"-\"), processMessage)\n \nEOF\n```",
