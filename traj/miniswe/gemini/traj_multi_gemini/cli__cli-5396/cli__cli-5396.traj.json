        "instance_template": "<pr_description>\nConsider the following PR description:\n{{task}}\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1. Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in the current working directory (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.ext\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.ext | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.ext\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.ext\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.ext | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.ext | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Multi-SWE-bench Specific Notes\n- You are working in a Multi-SWE-bench environment with multi-language repositories\n- The project may be in a subdirectory (e.g., /home/repo-name/)\n- Git repository is typically located in the project subdirectory\n- When working with Git operations, ensure you're in the correct repository directory\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.ext | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && (git status >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (cd */. 2>/dev/null && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (find . -name '.git' -type d -exec sh -c 'cd \"$(dirname \"{}\")\" && git add -A && git diff --cached' \\; 2>/dev/null | head -n 1000) || (echo \"Error: No git repository found\")\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

      "content": "THOUGHT\nI've examined `delete.go`. Here's what I've found:\n\n1.  `NewCmdDelete` sets up the `delete` command.\n2.  `deleteRun` contains the main logic.\n3.  The interactive confirmation logic is inside `deleteRun`:\n    ```go\n    if opts.IO.CanPrompt() {\n        // ... confirmation logic ...\n    }\n    ```\n4.  I need to add a flag, let's call it `--confirm` or `--yes` as is common, or just follow the PR description and call it `--confirm`. The PR description says `--confirm`.\n\nMy plan is:\n\n1.  **Add a `Confirm` field to `DeleteOptions` struct.** This will be a boolean to store the value of the flag.\n2.  **Add the `--confirm` flag in `NewCmdDelete`.** I'll use `cmd.Flags().BoolVarP` to add the flag.\n3.  **Modify the confirmation logic in `deleteRun`.** The confirmation prompt should be skipped if `opts.Confirm` is true.\n\nLet's start by modifying the `DeleteOptions` struct. I'll add `Confirm bool` to it.\n\n```go\ntype DeleteOptions struct {\n\tHttpClient func() (*http.Client, error)\n\tConfig     func() (config.Config, error)\n\tIO         *iostreams.IOStreams\n\tBaseRepo   func() (ghrepo.Interface, error)\n\n\tSelectorArg string\n\tConfirm     bool // I will add this\n}\n```\n\nThen, in `NewCmdDelete`:\n```go\n// ...\n\tcmd := &cobra.Command{\n\t\t// ...\n\t}\n\n\tcmd.Flags().BoolVarP(&opts.Confirm, \"confirm\", \"y\", false, \"Skip confirmation prompt\") // Or something similar\n\treturn cmd\n// ...\n```\nThe PR description says `--confirm` and doesn't mention a short form. I'll stick to that.\n\nFinally, in `deleteRun`:\n```go\n// ...\n\tif !opts.Confirm && opts.IO.CanPrompt() {\n\t\t// ... confirmation logic ...\n\t}\n// ...\n```\nThe PR description says \"Adds a `--confirm` flag to the `issue delete` subcommand to bypass interactive confirmation in a terminal\". It doesn't specify a short flag, so I'll just add `--confirm`.\n\nLet's start by adding the `Confirm` field to the `DeleteOptions` struct.\n\n```go\ntype DeleteOptions struct {\n\tHttpClient func() (*http.Client, error)\n\tConfig     func() (config.Config, error)\n\tIO         *iostreams.IOStreams\n\tBaseRepo   func() (ghrepo.Interface, error)\n\n\tSelectorArg string\n\t// I will add a field here\n}\n```\n\nI'll use `sed` to add `Confirm bool` to the struct.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '31aConfirm bool' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nWait, line numbers are brittle. Let's use a pattern.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/SelectorArg string/a \\\tConfirm     bool' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis is better.\n\nNow, let's add the flag.\n```go\n// in NewCmdDelete\n// ...\n\tcmd := &cobra.Command{\n// ...\n\t}\n\t// I will add the flag here\n\treturn cmd\n}\n```\nI'll add `cmd.Flags().BoolVar(&opts.Confirm, \"confirm\", false, \"Skip confirmation prompt\")` before `return cmd`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/return cmd/i \\\n\tcmd.Flags().BoolVar(&opts.Confirm, \"confirm\", false, \"Skip confirmation prompt\")' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThe PR description says \"bypass interactive confirmation\". The help text should probably reflect that. \"Bypass\" is a good word. Let's use \"Bypass confirmation prompt\".\n\nThe PR description says `--confirm`. It doesn't say anything about a short version. I'll use `BoolVar` and not `BoolVarP`. The help text should be \"Bypass confirmation prompt\".\n\nFinally, I need to change the condition for the prompt.\nFrom:\n```go\nif opts.IO.CanPrompt() {\n```\nTo:\n```go\nif !opts.Confirm && opts.IO.CanPrompt() {\n```\n\nI'll use `sed` for this as well.\n```bash\nsed -i 's/if opts.IO.CanPrompt() {/if !opts.Confirm && opts.IO.CanPrompt() {/' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\n\nLet's combine these into a single `sed` command if possible, or run them one by one. I'll do them one by one to be safe.\n\nFirst, add the field to the struct.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/SelectorArg string/a \\\tConfirm     bool' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis seems wrong. The `DeleteOptions` struct is defined from line 26 to 32.\n```go\n26 type DeleteOptions struct {\n27 \tHttpClient func() (*http.Client, error)\n28 \tConfig     func() (config.Config, error)\n29 \tIO         *iostreams.IOStreams\n30 \tBaseRepo   func() (ghrepo.Interface, error)\n31 \n32 \tSelectorArg string\n33 }\n```\nThere is a blank line. I'll add it after `SelectorArg`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/SelectorArg string/a \\\tConfirm bool' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis will add it on the next line. That's fine.\n\nLet's check the file again.\n```go\npackage delete\n\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"strconv\"\n\n\t\"github.com/AlecAivazis/survey/v2\"\n\t\"github.com/cli/cli/v2/internal/config\"\n\t\"github.com/cli/cli/v2/internal/ghinstance\"\n\t\"github.com/cli/cli/v2/internal/ghrepo\"\n\t\"github.com/cli/cli/v2/pkg/cmd/issue/shared\"\n\t\"github.com/cli/cli/v2/pkg/cmdutil\"\n\t\"github.com/cli/cli/v2/pkg/iostreams\"\n\t\"github.com/cli/cli/v2/pkg/prompt\"\n\tgraphql \"github.com/cli/shurcooL-graphql\"\n\t\"github.com/shurcooL/githubv4\"\n\t\"github.com/spf13/cobra\"\n)\n\ntype DeleteOptions struct {\n\tHttpClient func() (*http.Client, error)\n\tConfig     func() (config.Config, error)\n\tIO         *iostreams.IOStreams\n\tBaseRepo   func() (ghrepo.Interface, error)\n\n\tSelectorArg string\n}\n\nfunc NewCmdDelete(f *cmdutil.Factory, runF func(*DeleteOptions) error) *cobra.Command {\n\topts := &DeleteOptions{\n\t\tIO:         f.IOStreams,\n\t\tHttpClient: f.HttpClient,\n\t\tConfig:     f.Config,\n\t}\n\n\tcmd := &cobra.Command{\n\t\tUse:   \"delete {<number> | <url>}\",\n\t\tShort: \"Delete issue\",\n\t\tArgs:  cobra.ExactArgs(1),\n\t\tRunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {\n\t\t\t// support `-R, --repo` override\n\t\t\topts.BaseRepo = f.BaseRepo\n\n\t\t\tif len(args) > 0 {\n\t\t\t\topts.SelectorArg = args[0]\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\tif runF != nil {\n\t\t\t\treturn runF(opts)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\treturn deleteRun(opts)\n\t\t},\n\t}\n\n\treturn cmd\n}\n```\nThe struct definition is on lines 26-32.\nI'll add `Confirm bool` after `SelectorArg string`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/SelectorArg string/a \\\tConfirm     bool' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis will result in:\n```go\n\tSelectorArg string\n\tConfirm     bool\n}\n```\nThis is correct.\n\nNext, add the flag.\n```go\nfunc NewCmdDelete(f *cmdutil.Factory, runF func(*DeleteOptions) error) *cobra.Command {\n...\n\tcmd := &cobra.Command{\n...\n\t}\n\n\treturn cmd\n}\n```\nI'll add the flag definition before `return cmd`.\nThe PR description says \"Adds a `--confirm` flag\". The help text should be something like \"Confirm deletion without prompting\". The PR description says \"bypass interactive confirmation\". So \"Bypass confirmation\" is good.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/\\treturn cmd/i \\\n\\n\\tcmd.Flags().BoolVar(&opts.Confirm, \"confirm\", false, \"Bypass confirmation prompt\")' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis looks a bit complex. Let's check the line number for `return cmd`. It's line 63.\nI'll use a simpler `sed` command.\n```bash\nsed -i '63i \\\n\tcmd.Flags().BoolVar(&opts.Confirm, \"confirm\", false, \"Bypass confirmation prompt\")' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nUsing line numbers is brittle. Let's stick to patterns.\nThe original file has `return cmd` at line 63.\n```go\n...\n\t\t},\n\t}\n\n\treturn cmd\n}\n```\nThe `return cmd` is at the end of `NewCmdDelete`.\nI'll use `sed -i '/^\treturn cmd/i \\\n\\n\\tcmd.Flags().BoolVar(&opts.Confirm, \"confirm\", false, \"Bypass confirmation prompt\")' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go`\nThe `\\n` is to add a blank line for style.\n\nLet's check the `delete.go` file again.\n```go\n\t// ...\n\tcmd := &cobra.Command{\n\t\t// ...\n\t}\n\n\treturn cmd\n}\n```\nThere is a blank line before `return cmd`. So I should insert before the blank line.\n```bash\nsed -i '/\\treturn cmd/i \\\n\\tcmd.Flags().BoolVar(&opts.Confirm, \"confirm\", false, \"Bypass confirmation prompt\")\\n' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis will add a newline after, which is what I want.\n\nFinally, change the `if`.\n```go\nif opts.IO.CanPrompt() {\n```\nThis is on line 82.\n```bash\nsed -i 's/if opts.IO.CanPrompt() {/if !opts.Confirm && opts.IO.CanPrompt() {/' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis should work.\n\nLet's do it step by step. First, add the `Confirm` field to `DeleteOptions`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/SelectorArg string/a \\\tConfirm bool' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nWait, the PR description says `--confirm`. It's common to use `--yes` or `-y` for this. Let me check other commands in this project to see what's the convention.\n\nI'll check `pr delete`.\n`ls -F cli/pkg/cmd/pr/delete`\n`cat cli/pkg/cmd/pr/delete/delete.go`\n\nLet's check `pr delete` first.\n```bash\nls -F cli/pkg/cmd/pr/\n```\nThere is no `delete` in `pr`. Maybe `pr close`?\n`ls -F cli/pkg/cmd/pr/` shows `close`, `create`, `diff`, `list`, `merge`, `ready`, `reopen`, `review`, `status`, `view`.\nLet's check `repo delete`.\n`ls -F cli/pkg/cmd/repo/` shows `archive`, `clone`, `create`, `delete`, `fork`, `garden`, `list`, `rename`, `sync`, `view`.\n`cat cli/pkg/cmd/repo/delete/delete.go`\n\nI'll check `repo delete` for conventions.\n```bash\ncat cli/pkg/cmd/repo/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis file is likely to be long, so I'll just `grep` for flags.\n```bash\ngrep \"BoolVar\" cli/pkg/cmd/repo/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis will show me boolean flags.\n\n```bash\ngrep \"BoolVar\" cli/pkg/cmd/repo/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis is a search, not reading file content for my own analysis, so I don't need `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`.\nLet's see what flags are used for confirmation.\n```bash\ngrep \"Flags().*Bool\" cli/pkg/cmd/repo/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis is more specific.\n\n```bash\ngrep \"Flags().*Bool\" cli/pkg/cmd/repo/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis is still a search.\n\nLet's just look at the file.\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /home/user/workspace/cli/pkg/cmd/repo/delete/delete.go\nLines: 1-150\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n```bash\ncat cli/pkg/cmd/repo/delete/delete.go\n```\nI'll just `cat` the whole file.

                "content": "THOUGHT\nI've examined `delete.go`. Here's what I've found:\n\n1.  `NewCmdDelete` sets up the `delete` command.\n2.  `deleteRun` contains the main logic.\n3.  The interactive confirmation logic is inside `deleteRun`:\n    ```go\n    if opts.IO.CanPrompt() {\n        // ... confirmation logic ...\n    }\n    ```\n4.  I need to add a flag, let's call it `--confirm` or `--yes` as is common, or just follow the PR description and call it `--confirm`. The PR description says `--confirm`.\n\nMy plan is:\n\n1.  **Add a `Confirm` field to `DeleteOptions` struct.** This will be a boolean to store the value of the flag.\n2.  **Add the `--confirm` flag in `NewCmdDelete`.** I'll use `cmd.Flags().BoolVarP` to add the flag.\n3.  **Modify the confirmation logic in `deleteRun`.** The confirmation prompt should be skipped if `opts.Confirm` is true.\n\nLet's start by modifying the `DeleteOptions` struct. I'll add `Confirm bool` to it.\n\n```go\ntype DeleteOptions struct {\n\tHttpClient func() (*http.Client, error)\n\tConfig     func() (config.Config, error)\n\tIO         *iostreams.IOStreams\n\tBaseRepo   func() (ghrepo.Interface, error)\n\n\tSelectorArg string\n\tConfirm     bool // I will add this\n}\n```\n\nThen, in `NewCmdDelete`:\n```go\n// ...\n\tcmd := &cobra.Command{\n\t\t// ...\n\t}\n\n\tcmd.Flags().BoolVarP(&opts.Confirm, \"confirm\", \"y\", false, \"Skip confirmation prompt\") // Or something similar\n\treturn cmd\n// ...\n```\nThe PR description says `--confirm` and doesn't mention a short form. I'll stick to that.\n\nFinally, in `deleteRun`:\n```go\n// ...\n\tif !opts.Confirm && opts.IO.CanPrompt() {\n\t\t// ... confirmation logic ...\n\t}\n// ...\n```\nThe PR description says \"Adds a `--confirm` flag to the `issue delete` subcommand to bypass interactive confirmation in a terminal\". It doesn't specify a short flag, so I'll just add `--confirm`.\n\nLet's start by adding the `Confirm` field to the `DeleteOptions` struct.\n\n```go\ntype DeleteOptions struct {\n\tHttpClient func() (*http.Client, error)\n\tConfig     func() (config.Config, error)\n\tIO         *iostreams.IOStreams\n\tBaseRepo   func() (ghrepo.Interface, error)\n\n\tSelectorArg string\n\t// I will add a field here\n}\n```\n\nI'll use `sed` to add `Confirm bool` to the struct.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '31aConfirm bool' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nWait, line numbers are brittle. Let's use a pattern.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/SelectorArg string/a \\\tConfirm     bool' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis is better.\n\nNow, let's add the flag.\n```go\n// in NewCmdDelete\n// ...\n\tcmd := &cobra.Command{\n// ...\n\t}\n\t// I will add the flag here\n\treturn cmd\n}\n```\nI'll add `cmd.Flags().BoolVar(&opts.Confirm, \"confirm\", false, \"Skip confirmation prompt\")` before `return cmd`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/return cmd/i \\\n\tcmd.Flags().BoolVar(&opts.Confirm, \"confirm\", false, \"Skip confirmation prompt\")' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThe PR description says \"bypass interactive confirmation\". The help text should probably reflect that. \"Bypass\" is a good word. Let's use \"Bypass confirmation prompt\".\n\nThe PR description says `--confirm`. It doesn't say anything about a short version. I'll use `BoolVar` and not `BoolVarP`. The help text should be \"Bypass confirmation prompt\".\n\nFinally, I need to change the condition for the prompt.\nFrom:\n```go\nif opts.IO.CanPrompt() {\n```\nTo:\n```go\nif !opts.Confirm && opts.IO.CanPrompt() {\n```\n\nI'll use `sed` for this as well.\n```bash\nsed -i 's/if opts.IO.CanPrompt() {/if !opts.Confirm && opts.IO.CanPrompt() {/' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\n\nLet's combine these into a single `sed` command if possible, or run them one by one. I'll do them one by one to be safe.\n\nFirst, add the field to the struct.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/SelectorArg string/a \\\tConfirm     bool' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis seems wrong. The `DeleteOptions` struct is defined from line 26 to 32.\n```go\n26 type DeleteOptions struct {\n27 \tHttpClient func() (*http.Client, error)\n28 \tConfig     func() (config.Config, error)\n29 \tIO         *iostreams.IOStreams\n30 \tBaseRepo   func() (ghrepo.Interface, error)\n31 \n32 \tSelectorArg string\n33 }\n```\nThere is a blank line. I'll add it after `SelectorArg`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/SelectorArg string/a \\\tConfirm bool' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis will add it on the next line. That's fine.\n\nLet's check the file again.\n```go\npackage delete\n\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"strconv\"\n\n\t\"github.com/AlecAivazis/survey/v2\"\n\t\"github.com/cli/cli/v2/internal/config\"\n\t\"github.com/cli/cli/v2/internal/ghinstance\"\n\t\"github.com/cli/cli/v2/internal/ghrepo\"\n\t\"github.com/cli/cli/v2/pkg/cmd/issue/shared\"\n\t\"github.com/cli/cli/v2/pkg/cmdutil\"\n\t\"github.com/cli/cli/v2/pkg/iostreams\"\n\t\"github.com/cli/cli/v2/pkg/prompt\"\n\tgraphql \"github.com/cli/shurcooL-graphql\"\n\t\"github.com/shurcooL/githubv4\"\n\t\"github.com/spf13/cobra\"\n)\n\ntype DeleteOptions struct {\n\tHttpClient func() (*http.Client, error)\n\tConfig     func() (config.Config, error)\n\tIO         *iostreams.IOStreams\n\tBaseRepo   func() (ghrepo.Interface, error)\n\n\tSelectorArg string\n}\n\nfunc NewCmdDelete(f *cmdutil.Factory, runF func(*DeleteOptions) error) *cobra.Command {\n\topts := &DeleteOptions{\n\t\tIO:         f.IOStreams,\n\t\tHttpClient: f.HttpClient,\n\t\tConfig:     f.Config,\n\t}\n\n\tcmd := &cobra.Command{\n\t\tUse:   \"delete {<number> | <url>}\",\n\t\tShort: \"Delete issue\",\n\t\tArgs:  cobra.ExactArgs(1),\n\t\tRunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {\n\t\t\t// support `-R, --repo` override\n\t\t\topts.BaseRepo = f.BaseRepo\n\n\t\t\tif len(args) > 0 {\n\t\t\t\topts.SelectorArg = args[0]\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\tif runF != nil {\n\t\t\t\treturn runF(opts)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\treturn deleteRun(opts)\n\t\t},\n\t}\n\n\treturn cmd\n}\n```\nThe struct definition is on lines 26-32.\nI'll add `Confirm bool` after `SelectorArg string`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/SelectorArg string/a \\\tConfirm     bool' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis will result in:\n```go\n\tSelectorArg string\n\tConfirm     bool\n}\n```\nThis is correct.\n\nNext, add the flag.\n```go\nfunc NewCmdDelete(f *cmdutil.Factory, runF func(*DeleteOptions) error) *cobra.Command {\n...\n\tcmd := &cobra.Command{\n...\n\t}\n\n\treturn cmd\n}\n```\nI'll add the flag definition before `return cmd`.\nThe PR description says \"Adds a `--confirm` flag\". The help text should be something like \"Confirm deletion without prompting\". The PR description says \"bypass interactive confirmation\". So \"Bypass confirmation\" is good.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/\\treturn cmd/i \\\n\\n\\tcmd.Flags().BoolVar(&opts.Confirm, \"confirm\", false, \"Bypass confirmation prompt\")' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis looks a bit complex. Let's check the line number for `return cmd`. It's line 63.\nI'll use a simpler `sed` command.\n```bash\nsed -i '63i \\\n\tcmd.Flags().BoolVar(&opts.Confirm, \"confirm\", false, \"Bypass confirmation prompt\")' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nUsing line numbers is brittle. Let's stick to patterns.\nThe original file has `return cmd` at line 63.\n```go\n...\n\t\t},\n\t}\n\n\treturn cmd\n}\n```\nThe `return cmd` is at the end of `NewCmdDelete`.\nI'll use `sed -i '/^\treturn cmd/i \\\n\\n\\tcmd.Flags().BoolVar(&opts.Confirm, \"confirm\", false, \"Bypass confirmation prompt\")' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go`\nThe `\\n` is to add a blank line for style.\n\nLet's check the `delete.go` file again.\n```go\n\t// ...\n\tcmd := &cobra.Command{\n\t\t// ...\n\t}\n\n\treturn cmd\n}\n```\nThere is a blank line before `return cmd`. So I should insert before the blank line.\n```bash\nsed -i '/\\treturn cmd/i \\\n\\tcmd.Flags().BoolVar(&opts.Confirm, \"confirm\", false, \"Bypass confirmation prompt\")\\n' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis will add a newline after, which is what I want.\n\nFinally, change the `if`.\n```go\nif opts.IO.CanPrompt() {\n```\nThis is on line 82.\n```bash\nsed -i 's/if opts.IO.CanPrompt() {/if !opts.Confirm && opts.IO.CanPrompt() {/' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis should work.\n\nLet's do it step by step. First, add the `Confirm` field to `DeleteOptions`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '/SelectorArg string/a \\\tConfirm bool' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nWait, the PR description says `--confirm`. It's common to use `--yes` or `-y` for this. Let me check other commands in this project to see what's the convention.\n\nI'll check `pr delete`.\n`ls -F cli/pkg/cmd/pr/delete`\n`cat cli/pkg/cmd/pr/delete/delete.go`\n\nLet's check `pr delete` first.\n```bash\nls -F cli/pkg/cmd/pr/\n```\nThere is no `delete` in `pr`. Maybe `pr close`?\n`ls -F cli/pkg/cmd/pr/` shows `close`, `create`, `diff`, `list`, `merge`, `ready`, `reopen`, `review`, `status`, `view`.\nLet's check `repo delete`.\n`ls -F cli/pkg/cmd/repo/` shows `archive`, `clone`, `create`, `delete`, `fork`, `garden`, `list`, `rename`, `sync`, `view`.\n`cat cli/pkg/cmd/repo/delete/delete.go`\n\nI'll check `repo delete` for conventions.\n```bash\ncat cli/pkg/cmd/repo/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis file is likely to be long, so I'll just `grep` for flags.\n```bash\ngrep \"BoolVar\" cli/pkg/cmd/repo/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis will show me boolean flags.\n\n```bash\ngrep \"BoolVar\" cli/pkg/cmd/repo/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis is a search, not reading file content for my own analysis, so I don't need `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`.\nLet's see what flags are used for confirmation.\n```bash\ngrep \"Flags().*Bool\" cli/pkg/cmd/repo/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis is more specific.\n\n```bash\ngrep \"Flags().*Bool\" cli/pkg/cmd/repo/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis is still a search.\n\nLet's just look at the file.\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /home/user/workspace/cli/pkg/cmd/repo/delete/delete.go\nLines: 1-150\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n```bash\ncat cli/pkg/cmd/repo/delete/delete.go\n```\nI'll just `cat` the whole file. It's probably not too big. If it is, I'll use `head`.\n\n```bash\ncat cli/pkg/cmd/repo/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis is a read.

I need to escape it.\n\nLet's fix this. I need to restore the original line first.\nThe original line was `if opts.IO.CanPrompt() {`.\nI'll replace the messed up line with the original one.\n\nThe messed up line is: `if !opts.Confirm if opts.IO.CanPrompt() {if opts.IO.CanPrompt() { opts.IO.CanPrompt() {`\nI'll replace this with `if opts.IO.CanPrompt() {`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/if !opts.Confirm if opts.IO.CanPrompt() {if opts.IO.CanPrompt() { opts.IO.CanPrompt() {/if opts.IO.CanPrompt() {/' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis is risky as the pattern is long and might have special characters.\n\nI'll try to get a fresh copy of the file.

I need to escape it.\n\nLet's fix this. I need to restore the original line first.\nThe original line was `if opts.IO.CanPrompt() {`.\nI'll replace the messed up line with the original one.\n\nThe messed up line is: `if !opts.Confirm if opts.IO.CanPrompt() {if opts.IO.CanPrompt() { opts.IO.CanPrompt() {`\nI'll replace this with `if opts.IO.CanPrompt() {`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/if !opts.Confirm if opts.IO.CanPrompt() {if opts.IO.CanPrompt() { opts.IO.CanPrompt() {/if opts.IO.CanPrompt() {/' cli/pkg/cmd/issue/delete/delete.go\n```\nThis is risky as the pattern is long and might have special characters.\n\nI'll try to get a fresh copy of the file. I don't have git, but I have `fix.patch`. It's a patch, not the original file.\n\nLet's try to fix the line with `sed`.\nThe line number is 88.\nLet's see line 88.\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile:
