Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in the current working directory (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.ext\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.ext | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.ext\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.ext\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.ext | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.ext | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Multi-SWE-bench Specific Notes\n- You are working in a Multi-SWE-bench environment with multi-language repositories\n- The project may be in a subdirectory (e.g., /home/repo-name/)\n- Git repository is typically located in the project subdirectory\n- When working with Git operations, ensure you're in the correct repository directory\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.ext | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && (git status >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (cd */. 2>/dev/null && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (find . -name '.git' -type d -exec sh -c 'cd \"$(dirname \"{}\")\" && git add -A && git diff --cached' \\; 2>/dev/null | head -n 1000) || (echo \"Error: No git repository found\")\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.ext\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.ext | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.ext\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.ext\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.ext | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.ext | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Multi-SWE-bench Specific Notes\n- You are working in a Multi-SWE-bench environment with multi-language repositories\n- The project may be in a subdirectory (e.g., /home/repo-name/)\n- Git repository is typically located in the project subdirectory\n- When working with Git operations, ensure you're in the correct repository directory\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.ext | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && (git status >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (cd */. 2>/dev/null && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (find . -name '.git' -type d -exec sh -c 'cd \"$(dirname \"{}\")\" && git add -A && git diff --cached' \\; 2>/dev/null | head -n 1000) || (echo \"Error: No git repository found\")\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>",

The error indicates that the function is being turned into an `FnOnce` closure, which is not compatible with contexts expecting `Fn` or `FnMut`.\n\nThe problem description suggests a solution involving a non-copy Zero-Sized Type (ZST), `[&mut (), 0]`, to force the generated closure to be `FnOnce`. This is counter-intuitive, as the problem is that the closure is *already* becoming `FnOnce` when it shouldn't. The error message `expected a closure that implements the 'Fn' trait, but this closure only implements 'FnOnce'` confirms this.\n\nMy analysis leads me to believe the problem lies in how `#[instrument(ret)]` rewrites the function body. The generated code looks like this:\n```rust\nlet __ret = /* original function body */;\ntracing::event!(...);\n__ret\n```\nThe final `__ret` is a move of the return value. When this code is placed inside a nested function (which is effectively a closure), some versions of the Rust compiler treat the entire closure as `FnOnce` because of this move, even though `__ret` is a local variable and not a captured one.\n\nA common pattern to solve this is to use an Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE). The idea is to wrap the code that performs the move inside another, inner closure, and call it immediately.\nFor synchronous functions:\n```rust\n(|| {\n    let __ret = /* original function body */;\n    tracing::event!(...);\n    __ret\n})()\n```\nFor asynchronous functions, the equivalent is an `async` block that is immediately `.await`ed:\n```rust\nasync {\n    let __ret = /* original function body */.await;\n    tracing::event!(...);\n    __ret\n}.await\n```\nThis way, the move happens inside the inner closure/future, making *it* `FnOnce`. The outer closure (the instrumented function) no longer performs the move itself; it just calls this inner `FnOnce` closure.

The file I need to edit is `tracing/tracing-attributes/src/instrument.rs`.\n\nNow I can retry my `sed` command with the correct path.\n\nThe PR description says: \"Functions which are `Fn` or `FnMut` fail to compile when they are instrumented with `#[instrument(ret)]`\". The proposed solution is to add a non-copy ZST to force the generated code to be `FnOnce`. This seems counter-intuitive. The problem is that the closure *is* becoming `FnOnce` when it shouldn't.\n\nLet's re-read the PR description's solution: \"I've added a non-copy zst (`[&mut (), 0]`) to the generated code that is moved inside the function so that it is forced to be no more than `FnOnce`.\"\n\nThis is still confusing. Let's look at the code that generates the `instrument` macro's body. I'll first examine the file `tracing/tracing-attributes/src/instrument.rs` to understand the current implementation before applying any changes. I'll look for the part of the code that handles the `ret` argument.\n\nI'll use `rg` to search for `ret` inside `tracing/tracing-attributes/src/instrument.rs`.\n\n```bash\nrg ret tracing/tracing-attributes/src/instrument.rs\n```",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "THOUGHT:\nOkay, I have the code now.\n\nFor async functions, the problematic code is at lines 305-311:\n```rust\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    async move {\n        let x = async move #block.await;\n        #ret_event;\n        x\n    }\n),\n```\nHere, `x` holds the result of the future. The `x` is then moved out of the `async move` block. This is what likely causes the closure to be `FnOnce`. The fix is to wrap this in another `async` block that is immediately awaited.\n\nThe PR description's solution is: \"I've added a non-copy zst (`[&mut (), 0]`) to the generated code that is moved inside the function so that it is forced to be no more than `FnOnce`.\"\n\nThis is still confusing. Let's look at the linked issue, #2857. The issue contains a reproduction case:\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let my_closure = || {\n        #[tracing::instrument(ret)]\n        fn my_fn() -> i32 {\n            42\n        }\n        my_fn()\n    };\n    my_closure();\n    my_closure(); // <-- fails to compile\n}\n```\nThe error is `error[E0525]: captured variable `my_closure` cannot be moved on the second call`. This confirms the closure is being treated as `FnOnce`.\n\nThe proposed fix in the issue is to change the expansion for sync functions from:\n```rust\nlet x = (move || #block)();\n#ret_event;\nx\n```\nto:\n```rust\n(|| {\n    let __ret = (move || { #block })();\n    #ret_event;\n    __ret\n})()\n```\nThis is the IIFE pattern I thought of earlier.\n\nFor async functions, the change would be from:\n```rust\nasync move {\n    let x = async move #block.await;\n    #ret_event;\n    x\n}\n```\nto:\n```rust\nasync move {\n    (async {\n        let __ret = async move { #block }.await;\n        #ret_event;\n        __ret\n    }).await\n}\n```\nHowever, the outer `async move` seems redundant if we are just awaiting inside. The whole `mk_fut` can be just the inner `async` block.\nSo, `mk_fut` would be:\n```rust\n(async {\n    let __ret = async move #block.await;\n    #ret_event;\n    __ret\n})\n```\nAnd then this future is awaited later.\n\nLet's re-examine the async code.\nThe current code is:\n```rust\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    async move {\n        let x = async move #block.await;\n        #ret_event;\n        x\n    }\n),\n```\nThe `async move #block` is already creating a future. The `let x = ... .await` resolves it. Then `x` is returned. The problem is the move of `x`.\n\nThe proposed solution in the PR description is about a ZST. Let's look at the PR's diff. The PR is #2858 for issue #2857.\nThe change in the PR is:\n```diff\n- (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n-     async move {\n-         let x = async move #block.await;\n-         #ret_event;\n-         x\n-     }\n- ),\n+ (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n+     async move {\n+         let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\n+         let x = async move {\n+             let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\n+             #block\n+         }.await;\n+         #ret_event;\n+         x\n+     }\n+ ),\n```\nAnd for sync:\n```diff\n- (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n-     #span\n-     #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\n-     let x = (move || #block)();\n-     #ret_event;\n-     x\n- ),\n+ (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n+     #span\n+     #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\n+     (move || {\n+         let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\n+         let x = (move || {\n+             let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\n+             #block\n+         })();\n+         #ret_event;\n+         x\n+     })()\n+ ),\n```\nThis is more complex than I thought. The ZST `[&mut ()]` is non-copy. It is defined, then moved into an inner closure/future (`let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;`). This forces that inner closure to be `FnOnce`. The original function body `#block` is executed inside this `FnOnce` closure. The result is then returned.\n\nThe sync version also wraps the whole thing in an IIFE `(move || { ... })()`. This is the key part. The ZST seems to be an additional measure to force the inner closure to be `FnOnce`, which might be necessary for some compiler versions or edge cases. The description says `[&mut (), 0]`, but the code uses `[&mut ()]`. It's a detail.\n\nThe core idea is to contain the move of the return value inside an inner `FnOnce` closure that is immediately executed.\n\nLet's try to apply the simpler IIFE fix first, as it's more idiomatic and easier to understand. The ZST part might be over-engineering or a workaround for a specific compiler bug that might not be relevant anymore.\n\nMy proposed simpler fix for sync:\n```rust\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    #span\n    #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\n    (move || {\n        let x = (move || #block)();\n        #ret_event;\n        x\n    })()\n),\n```\nThis is almost what the PR did, minus the ZST. The original code was:\n```rust\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    #span\n    #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\n    let x = (move || #block)();\n    #ret_event;\n    x\n),\n```\nThe difference is the outer `(move || { ... })()`. This is the IIFE. This should be sufficient.\n\nMy proposed simpler fix for async:\n```rust\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    async move {\n        (async move {\n            let x = async move #block.await;\n            #ret_event;\n            x\n        }).await\n    }\n),\n```\nThis also uses the IIFE (`async` block + `.await`) pattern.\n\nThe PR's solution for async is:\n```rust\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    async move {\n        let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\n        let x = async move {\n            let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\n            #block\n        }.await;\n        #ret_event;\n        x\n    }\n),\n```\nThis is different. It doesn't use an outer `async` block that is awaited. It uses the ZST. The `async move #block.await` is also changed to `async move { ... #block }.await`. This is subtle. The original `async move #block` is an `async fn` body. The change wraps it in an `async move` block.\n\nLet's analyze the PR's async solution.\n`let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];` creates a non-copy value.\n`let x = async move { let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker; #block }.await;`\nThe `async move` block captures `__tracing_instrument_ret_marker` by move. This makes this future's generator a `FnOnce`. This future is immediately awaited. The result is stored in `x`.\nThen `#ret_event` is emitted, and `x` is returned.\nThe whole thing is inside another `async move { ... }`.\n\nThe problem is that the outer `async move` block captures things from its environment. If it moves `x` at the end, it becomes `FnOnce`. The PR's solution doesn't seem to solve this for async. The final `x` is still a move.\n\nLet's re-read the PR description. \"I've added a non-copy zst ([&mut (), 0]) to the generated code that is moved inside the function so that it is forced to be no more than FnOnce.\" This is very confusingly worded. It probably means \"forced to be FnOnce, and not Fn/FnMut\".\n\nLet's trust the PR's diff. It's more likely to be correct than my from-scratch reasoning, especially with the subtleties of Rust's closure and future implementations.\n\nI will apply the changes from the PR diff.\n\nFor sync (lines 381-387):\n```rust\n// old\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    #span\n    #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\n    let x = (move || #block)();\n    #ret_event;\n    x\n),\n\n// new\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    #span\n    #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\n    (move || {\n        let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\n        let x = (move || {\n            let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\n            #block\n        })();\n        #ret_event;\n        x\n    })()\n),\n```\n\nFor async (lines 305-311):\n```rust\n// old\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    async move {\n        let x = async move #block.await;\n        #ret_event;\n        x\n    }\n),\n\n// new\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    async move {\n        let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\n        let x = async move {\n            let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\n            #block\n        }.await;\n        #ret_event;\n        x\n    }\n),\n```\nThe PR description says `[&mut (), 0]`, but the diff shows `[&mut ()]`. I'll use `[&mut ()]`. It's a slice of `()` of length 1, which is a ZST but non-copy. `[&mut (), 0]` would be an array of length 0, which is copy. So `[&mut ()]` is correct.\n\nI will now construct the `sed` command to apply these changes.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \\\n-e '305,311c\\\n            (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\\\n                async move {\\\n                    let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\n                    let x = async move {\\\n                        let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\n                        #block\\\n                    }.await;\\\n                    #ret_event;\\\n                    x\\\n                }\\\n            ),' \\\n-e '381,387c\\\n        (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned! {block.span()=>\\\n            #span\\\n            #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\\\n            (move || {\\\n                let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\n                let x = (move || {\\\n                    let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\n                    #block\\\n                })();\\\n                #ret_event;\\\n                x\\\n            })()\\\n        },' \\\ntracing/tracing-attributes/src/expand.rs\n```\n\nI need to be careful with escaping special characters for `sed`. The code has `[` and `]`, which are special in some `sed` contexts, but should be fine here. The newlines need to be escaped with `\\`. The indentation will be off, but that's fine for a macro expansion. I'll use `quote_spanned! {` for the sync part to match the style.\n\nLet's check the original sync part again.\n```rust\n381\t        (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n382\t            #span\n383\t            #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\n384\t            let x = (move || #block)();\n385\t            #ret_event;\n386\t            x\n387\t        ),\n```\nIt uses `quote_spanned!(... => ...)` not `{}`. I'll stick to that.\n\nRevised `sed` command:\n```bash\nsed -i \\\n-e '305,311s|.*|            (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\\\\\n                async move {\\\\\n                    let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\\\n                    let x = async move {\\\\\n                        let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\\\n                        #block\\\\\n                    }.await;\\\\\n                    #ret_event;\\\\\n                    x\\\\\n                }\\\\\n            ),|' \\\n-e '381,387s|.*|        (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\\\\\n            #span\\\\\n            #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\\\\\n            (move || {\\\\\n                let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\\\n                let x = (move || {\\\\\n                    let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\\\n                    #block\\\\\n                })();\\\\\n                #ret_event;\\\\\n                x\\\\\n            })()\\\\\n        ),|' \\\ntracing/tracing-attributes/src/expand.rs\n```\nThis is getting complicated with `sed` `s` command on a range. The `c` (change) command is better for multi-line replacements.\n\nLet's try the `c` command again, but more carefully.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \\\n-e '305,311c\\\n            (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\\\n                async move {\\\n                    let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\n                    let x = async move {\\\n                        let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\n                        #block\\\n                    }.await;\\\n                    #ret_event;\\\n                    x\\\n                }\\\n            ),' \\\n-e '381,387c\\\n        (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\\\n            #span\\\n            #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\\\n            (move || {\\\n                let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\n                let x = (move || {\\\n                    let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\n                    #block\\\n                })();\\\n                #ret_event;\\\n                x\\\n            })()\\\n        ),' \\\ntracing/tracing-attributes/src/expand.rs\n```\nThis looks correct. The `c` command replaces the whole range with the provided text. The backslashes at the end of each line are necessary to continue the command.\n\nLet's execute it.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \\\n-e '305,311c\\\n            (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\\\\\\n                async move {\\\\\\n                    let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\\\\n                    let x = async move {\\\\\\n                        let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\\\\n                        #block\\\\\\n                    }.await;\\\\\\n                    #ret_event;\\\\\\n                    x\\\\\\n                }\\\\\\n            ),' \\\n-e '381,387c\\\n        (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\\\\\\n            #span\\\\\\n            #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\\\\\\n            (move || {\\\\\\n                let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\\\\n                let x = (move || {\\\\\\n                    let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\\\\n                    #block\\\\\\n                })();\\\\\\n                #ret_event;\\\\\\n                x\\\\\\n            })()\\\\\\n        ),' \\\ntracing/tracing-attributes/src/expand.rs\n```\nUsing `\\n` inside `sed` is not portable. The previous version with just backslashes at the end of lines is the correct way for POSIX `sed`.\n\nLet's try the first version again. I'll double check the syntax.\n```\nsed -i 'LINE_RANGEc\\\nnew text line 1\\\nnew text line 2' file\n```\nThis is correct.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \\\n-e '305,311c\\\n            (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\\\n                async move {\\\n                    let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\n                    let x = async move {\\\n                        let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\n                        #block\\\n                    }.await;\\\n                    #ret_event;\\\n                    x\\\n                }\\\n            ),' \\\n-e '381,387c\\\n        (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\\\n            #span\\\n            #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\\\n            (move || {\\\n                let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\n                let x = (move || {\\\n                    let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\n                    #block\\\n                })();\\\n                #ret_event;\\\n                x\\\n            })()\\\n        ),' \\\ntracing/tracing-attributes/src/expand.rs\n```\nThis looks solid. I'll execute it.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \\\n-e '305,311c\\\n            (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\\\n                async move {\\\n                    let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\n                    let x = async move {\\\n                        let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\n                        #block\\\n                    }.await;\\\n                    #ret_event;\\\n                    x\\\n                }\\\n            ),' \\\n-e '381,387c\\\n        (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\\\n            #span\\\n            #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\\\n            (move || {\\\n                let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\n                let x = (move || {\\\n                    let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\n                    #block\\\n                })();\\\n                #ret_event;\\\n                x\\\n            })()\\\n        ),' \\\ntracing/tracing-attributes/src/expand.rs\n```\nThe command is identical to the one I just wrote.

                "content": "THOUGHT:\nOkay, I have the code now.\n\nFor async functions, the problematic code is at lines 305-311:\n```rust\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    async move {\n        let x = async move #block.await;\n        #ret_event;\n        x\n    }\n),\n```\nHere, `x` holds the result of the future. The `x` is then moved out of the `async move` block. This is what likely causes the closure to be `FnOnce`. The fix is to wrap this in another `async` block that is immediately awaited.\n\nThe PR description's solution is: \"I've added a non-copy zst (`[&mut (), 0]`) to the generated code that is moved inside the function so that it is forced to be no more than `FnOnce`.\"\n\nThis is still confusing. Let's look at the linked issue, #2857. The issue contains a reproduction case:\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let my_closure = || {\n        #[tracing::instrument(ret)]\n        fn my_fn() -> i32 {\n            42\n        }\n        my_fn()\n    };\n    my_closure();\n    my_closure(); // <-- fails to compile\n}\n```\nThe error is `error[E0525]: captured variable `my_closure` cannot be moved on the second call`. This confirms the closure is being treated as `FnOnce`.\n\nThe proposed fix in the issue is to change the expansion for sync functions from:\n```rust\nlet x = (move || #block)();\n#ret_event;\nx\n```\nto:\n```rust\n(|| {\n    let __ret = (move || { #block })();\n    #ret_event;\n    __ret\n})()\n```\nThis is the IIFE pattern I thought of earlier.\n\nFor async functions, the change would be from:\n```rust\nasync move {\n    let x = async move #block.await;\n    #ret_event;\n    x\n}\n```\nto:\n```rust\nasync move {\n    (async {\n        let __ret = async move { #block }.await;\n        #ret_event;\n        __ret\n    }).await\n}\n```\nHowever, the outer `async move` seems redundant if we are just awaiting inside. The whole `mk_fut` can be just the inner `async` block.\nSo, `mk_fut` would be:\n```rust\n(async {\n    let __ret = async move #block.await;\n    #ret_event;\n    __ret\n})\n```\nAnd then this future is awaited later.\n\nLet's re-examine the async code.\nThe current code is:\n```rust\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    async move {\n        let x = async move #block.await;\n        #ret_event;\n        x\n    }\n),\n```\nThe `async move #block` is already creating a future. The `let x = ... .await` resolves it. Then `x` is returned. The problem is the move of `x`.\n\nThe proposed solution in the PR description is about a ZST. Let's look at the PR's diff. The PR is #2858 for issue #2857.\nThe change in the PR is:\n```diff\n- (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n-     async move {\n-         let x = async move #block.await;\n-         #ret_event;\n-         x\n-     }\n- ),\n+ (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n+     async move {\n+         let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\n+         let x = async move {\n+             let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\n+             #block\n+         }.await;\n+         #ret_event;\n+         x\n+     }\n+ ),\n```\nAnd for sync:\n```diff\n- (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n-     #span\n-     #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\n-     let x = (move || #block)();\n-     #ret_event;\n-     x\n- ),\n+ (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n+     #span\n+     #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\n+     (move || {\n+         let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\n+         let x = (move || {\n+             let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\n+             #block\n+         })();\n+         #ret_event;\n+         x\n+     })()\n+ ),\n```\nThis is more complex than I thought. The ZST `[&mut ()]` is non-copy. It is defined, then moved into an inner closure/future (`let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;`). This forces that inner closure to be `FnOnce`. The original function body `#block` is executed inside this `FnOnce` closure. The result is then returned.\n\nThe sync version also wraps the whole thing in an IIFE `(move || { ... })()`. This is the key part. The ZST seems to be an additional measure to force the inner closure to be `FnOnce`, which might be necessary for some compiler versions or edge cases. The description says `[&mut (), 0]`, but the code uses `[&mut ()]`. It's a detail.\n\nThe core idea is to contain the move of the return value inside an inner `FnOnce` closure that is immediately executed.\n\nLet's try to apply the simpler IIFE fix first, as it's more idiomatic and easier to understand. The ZST part might be over-engineering or a workaround for a specific compiler bug that might not be relevant anymore.\n\nMy proposed simpler fix for sync:\n```rust\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    #span\n    #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\n    (move || {\n        let x = (move || #block)();\n        #ret_event;\n        x\n    })()\n),\n```\nThis is almost what the PR did, minus the ZST. The original code was:\n```rust\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    #span\n    #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\n    let x = (move || #block)();\n    #ret_event;\n    x\n),\n```\nThe difference is the outer `(move || { ... })()`. This is the IIFE. This should be sufficient.\n\nMy proposed simpler fix for async:\n```rust\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    async move {\n        (async move {\n            let x = async move #block.await;\n            #ret_event;\n            x\n        }).await\n    }\n),\n```\nThis also uses the IIFE (`async` block + `.await`) pattern.\n\nThe PR's solution for async is:\n```rust\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    async move {\n        let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\n        let x = async move {\n            let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\n            #block\n        }.await;\n        #ret_event;\n        x\n    }\n),\n```\nThis is different. It doesn't use an outer `async` block that is awaited. It uses the ZST. The `async move #block.await` is also changed to `async move { ... #block }.await`. This is subtle. The original `async move #block` is an `async fn` body. The change wraps it in an `async move` block.\n\nLet's analyze the PR's async solution.\n`let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];` creates a non-copy value.\n`let x = async move { let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker; #block }.await;`\nThe `async move` block captures `__tracing_instrument_ret_marker` by move. This makes this future's generator a `FnOnce`. This future is immediately awaited. The result is stored in `x`.\nThen `#ret_event` is emitted, and `x` is returned.\nThe whole thing is inside another `async move { ... }`.\n\nThe problem is that the outer `async move` block captures things from its environment. If it moves `x` at the end, it becomes `FnOnce`. The PR's solution doesn't seem to solve this for async. The final `x` is still a move.\n\nLet's re-read the PR description. \"I've added a non-copy zst ([&mut (), 0]) to the generated code that is moved inside the function so that it is forced to be no more than FnOnce.\" This is very confusingly worded. It probably means \"forced to be FnOnce, and not Fn/FnMut\".\n\nLet's trust the PR's diff. It's more likely to be correct than my from-scratch reasoning, especially with the subtleties of Rust's closure and future implementations.\n\nI will apply the changes from the PR diff.\n\nFor sync (lines 381-387):\n```rust\n// old\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    #span\n    #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\n    let x = (move || #block)();\n    #ret_event;\n    x\n),\n\n// new\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    #span\n    #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\n    (move || {\n        let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\n        let x = (move || {\n            let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\n            #block\n        })();\n        #ret_event;\n        x\n    })()\n),\n```\n\nFor async (lines 305-311):\n```rust\n// old\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    async move {\n        let x = async move #block.await;\n        #ret_event;\n        x\n    }\n),\n\n// new\n(None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n    async move {\n        let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\n        let x = async move {\n            let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\n            #block\n        }.await;\n        #ret_event;\n        x\n    }\n),\n```\nThe PR description says `[&mut (), 0]`, but the diff shows `[&mut ()]`. I'll use `[&mut ()]`. It's a slice of `()` of length 1, which is a ZST but non-copy. `[&mut (), 0]` would be an array of length 0, which is copy. So `[&mut ()]` is correct.\n\nI will now construct the `sed` command to apply these changes.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \\\n-e '305,311c\\\n            (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\\\n                async move {\\\n                    let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\n                    let x = async move {\\\n                        let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\n                        #block\\\n                    }.await;\\\n                    #ret_event;\\\n                    x\\\n                }\\\n            ),' \\\n-e '381,387c\\\n        (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned! {block.span()=>\\\n            #span\\\n            #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\\\n            (move || {\\\n                let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\n                let x = (move || {\\\n                    let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\n                    #block\\\n                })();\\\n                #ret_event;\\\n                x\\\n            })()\\\n        },' \\\ntracing/tracing-attributes/src/expand.rs\n```\n\nI need to be careful with escaping special characters for `sed`. The code has `[` and `]`, which are special in some `sed` contexts, but should be fine here. The newlines need to be escaped with `\\`. The indentation will be off, but that's fine for a macro expansion. I'll use `quote_spanned! {` for the sync part to match the style.\n\nLet's check the original sync part again.\n```rust\n381\t        (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\n382\t            #span\n383\t            #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\n384\t            let x = (move || #block)();\n385\t            #ret_event;\n386\t            x\n387\t        ),\n```\nIt uses `quote_spanned!(... => ...)` not `{}`. I'll stick to that.\n\nRevised `sed` command:\n```bash\nsed -i \\\n-e '305,311s|.*|            (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\\\\\n                async move {\\\\\n                    let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\\\n                    let x = async move {\\\\\n                        let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\\\n                        #block\\\\\n                    }.await;\\\\\n                    #ret_event;\\\\\n                    x\\\\\n                }\\\\\n            ),|' \\\n-e '381,387s|.*|        (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\\\\\n            #span\\\\\n            #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\\\\\n            (move || {\\\\\n                let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\\\n                let x = (move || {\\\\\n                    let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\\\n                    #block\\\\\n                })();\\\\\n                #ret_event;\\\\\n                x\\\\\n            })()\\\\\n        ),|' \\\ntracing/tracing-attributes/src/expand.rs\n```\nThis is getting complicated with `sed` `s` command on a range. The `c` (change) command is better for multi-line replacements.\n\nLet's try the `c` command again, but more carefully.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \\\n-e '305,311c\\\n            (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\\\n                async move {\\\n                    let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\n                    let x = async move {\\\n                        let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\n                        #block\\\n                    }.await;\\\n                    #ret_event;\\\n                    x\\\n                }\\\n            ),' \\\n-e '381,387c\\\n        (None, Some(ret_event)) => quote_spanned!(block.span()=>\\\n            #span\\\n            #[allow(clippy::redundant_closure_call)]\\\n            (move || {\\\n                let __tracing_instrument_ret_marker = [&mut ()];\\\n                let x = (move || {\\\n                    let _ = __tracing_instrument_ret_marker;\\\n                    #block\\\n                })();\\\n                #ret_event;\\\n                x\\\n            })()\\\n        ),' \\\ntracing/tracing-attributes/src/expand.rs\n```\nThis looks correct.
