Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in the current working directory (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.ext\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.ext | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.ext\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.ext\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.ext | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.ext | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Multi-SWE-bench Specific Notes\n- You are working in a Multi-SWE-bench environment with multi-language repositories\n- The project may be in a subdirectory (e.g., /home/repo-name/)\n- Git repository is typically located in the project subdirectory\n- When working with Git operations, ensure you're in the correct repository directory\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.ext | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && (git status >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (cd */. 2>/dev/null && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (find . -name '.git' -type d -exec sh -c 'cd \"$(dirname \"{}\")\" && git add -A && git diff --cached' \\; 2>/dev/null | head -n 1000) || (echo \"Error: No git repository found\")\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

This should return one workflow.\n`getWorkflowByID` returns a `*Workflow`.\n`FindWorkflow` wraps it in a slice `[]Workflow{*workflow}` and returns.\n`ResolveWorkflow` gets a slice with one workflow. `len(workflows)` is 1.\nIt returns `&workflows[0]`.\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo why would it fail? The error is \"could not find any workflows named <workflow-id>\".\nThis error comes from `ResolveWorkflow` line 206: `return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"could not find any workflows named %s\", workflowSelector)`\nThis happens if `len(workflows) == 0`.\n\nSo `FindWorkflow` is returning an empty slice.\nThis means `getWorkflowByID` is returning an error.\nWhat error? Let's look at `getWorkflowByID` again.\n\n```go\n// ID can be either a numeric database ID or the workflow file name\nfunc getWorkflowByID(client *api.Client, repo ghrepo.Interface, ID string) (*Workflow, error) {\n\tvar workflow Workflow\n\n\tpath := fmt.Sprintf(\"repos/%s/actions/workflows/%s\", ghrepo.FullName(repo), url.PathEscape(ID))\n\tif err := client.REST(repo.RepoHost(), \"GET\", path, nil, &workflow); err != nil {\n\t\treturn nil, err\n\t}\n\n\treturn &workflow, nil\n}\n```\nThe REST call can fail. If it returns a 404, for example, `getWorkflowByID` returns an error.\nThen `FindWorkflow` returns that error.\nThen `ResolveWorkflow` returns that error.\nThen `listRun` receives the error and prefixes it with \"failed to get runs: \".\n\nBut the reported error is \"could not find any workflows named...\". This is generated inside `ResolveWorkflow` when `len(workflows) == 0` and `err == nil`.\n\nSo `FindWorkflow` returns `([]Workflow{}, nil)`.\nWhen does `FindWorkflow` do that?\n\n```go\n// FindWorkflow looks up a workflow either by numeric database ID, file name, or its Name field\nfunc FindWorkflow(client *api.Client, repo ghrepo.Interface, workflowSelector string, states []WorkflowState) ([]Workflow, error) {\n\tif workflowSelector == \"\" {\n\t\treturn nil, errors.New(\"empty workflow selector\")\n\t}\n\n\tif _, err := strconv.Atoi(workflowSelector); err == nil || isWorkflowFile(workflowSelector) {\n\t\tworkflow, err := getWorkflowByID(client, repo, workflowSelector)\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\treturn nil, err // This returns an error, not an empty slice.\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn []Workflow{*workflow}, nil\n\t}\n\n\treturn getWorkflowsByName(client, repo, workflowSelector, states)\n}\n```\nIf `getWorkflowByID` returns an error, `FindWorkflow` returns that error. This doesn't lead to the observed error message.\n\nThe other path is `getWorkflowsByName`.\n```go\nfunc getWorkflowsByName(client *api.Client, repo ghrepo.Interface, name string, states []WorkflowState) ([]Workflow, error) {\n\tworkflows, err := GetWorkflows(client, repo, 0)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn nil, fmt.Errorf(\"couldn't fetch workflows for %s: %w\", ghrepo.FullName(repo), err)\n\t}\n\n\tvar filtered []Workflow\n\tfor _, workflow := range workflows {\n\t\tif !strings.EqualFold(workflow.Name, name) {\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\t}\n\t\tfor _, state := range states {\n\t\t\tif workflow.State == state {\n\t\t\t\tfiltered = append(filtered, workflow)\n\t\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn filtered, nil\n}\n```\n`getWorkflowsByName` can return an empty slice and no error. This happens if no workflow name matches.\n\nSo, the issue is that when `workflowSelector` is a number (an ID), it's being passed to `getWorkflowsByName`. This means the condition `_, err := strconv.Atoi(workflowSelector); err == nil || isWorkflowFile(workflowSelector)` is false.\n\nWhy would `strconv.Atoi` fail for a string of digits? It shouldn't.\n\nWait, I see something. In `listRun`:\n```go\nif workflow, err := workflowShared.ResolveWorkflow(opts.IO, client, baseRepo, false, opts.WorkflowSelector, states); err == nil {\n    filters.WorkflowID = workflow.ID\n    filters.WorkflowName = workflow.Name\n} else {\n    return err\n}\n```\nThis looks fine.\n\nLet's re-read the issue description. \"gh run list -w <workflow-id> fails with \"could not find any workflows named <workflow-id>\"\".\n\nThis means `FindWorkflow` is calling `getWorkflowsByName` with the ID.\nSo `strconv.Atoi(workflowSelector)` is failing.\nBut `workflowSelector` is the ID string.\n\nAh, I think I see a problem in `FindWorkflow`.\n```go\nif _, err := strconv.Atoi(workflowSelector); err == nil || isWorkflowFile(workflowSelector) {\n    workflow, err := getWorkflowByID(client, repo, workflowSelector)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    return []Workflow{*workflow}, nil\n}\n```\nIf `getWorkflowByID` returns a 404 Not Found error, `FindWorkflow` propagates it up.\n`ResolveWorkflow` receives the error and returns it.\n`listRun` receives it and returns it, prefixed with its own message.\n\nThe user is seeing \"could not find any workflows named...\". This comes from `ResolveWorkflow` line 206. This means `FindWorkflow` returned `([], nil)`.\n\nThis happens when `getWorkflowsByName` finds no matches.\nSo `FindWorkflow` is calling `getWorkflowsByName` even for a numeric ID.\n\nThis implies `strconv.Atoi(workflowSelector)` is failing. Why?\nMaybe the ID is too large for an `int`? `strconv.Atoi` is equivalent to `ParseInt(s, 10, 0)`, which uses `int` size. Workflow IDs are `int64`. On a 32-bit system, `int` is 32 bits, and a large workflow ID could overflow. `strconv.ParseInt` should be used instead.\n\nLet's check `go.mod` for the Go version.\n\n```bash\ncat cli/go.mod\n```",

I don't think this is the issue.\n\nLet's re-examine `FindWorkflow`.\n```go\n// FindWorkflow looks up a workflow either by numeric database ID, file name, or its Name field\nfunc FindWorkflow(client *api.Client, repo ghrepo.Interface, workflowSelector string, states []WorkflowState) ([]Workflow, error) {\n\tif workflowSelector == \"\" {\n\t\treturn nil, errors.New(\"empty workflow selector\")\n\t}\n\n\tif _, err := strconv.Atoi(workflowSelector); err == nil || isWorkflowFile(workflowSelector) {\n\t\tworkflow, err := getWorkflowByID(client, repo, workflowSelector)\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\treturn nil, err\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn []Workflow{*workflow}, nil\n\t}\n\n\treturn getWorkflowsByName(client, repo, workflowSelector, states)\n}\n```\nWhat if `getWorkflowByID` returns a 404 error, but we want to fall back to searching by name?\nFor example, a user might have a workflow named \"12345\".\nIf `getWorkflowByID` returns an error, `FindWorkflow` returns that error immediately. It doesn't proceed to `getWorkflowsByName`.\n\nIf the API call `GET /repos/.../actions/workflows/12345` returns 404, `getWorkflowByID` returns an error. `FindWorkflow` returns that error. `ResolveWorkflow` gets the error. `listRun` gets the error and prints `failed to get runs: <http 404 error>`. This is not what the user reports.\n\nThe user reports \"could not find any workflows named <workflow-id>\". This means `FindWorkflow` returned `([], nil)`. This means `getWorkflowsByName` was called and returned no results.\n\nThis means `strconv.Atoi(workflowSelector)` failed.\nAnd `isWorkflowFile(workflowSelector)` was false.\n\nSo if `workflowSelector` is \"12345\", `isWorkflowFile` is false. `strconv.Atoi` should succeed.\nWhat if the workflow ID is very large? `strconv.Atoi` returns an `int` and an error. If the value is out of range for `int`, it returns an error.\nThe workflow ID is `int64`. `int` could be 32-bit.\nLet's check `Workflow.ID` type.\n```go\ntype Workflow struct {\n\tName  string\n\tID    int64\n\tPath  string\n\tState WorkflowState\n}\n```\nIt's `int64`. So it's possible `strconv.Atoi` fails.\n\nIf `strconv.Atoi` fails, it falls through to `getWorkflowsByName`. If there's no workflow with the name \"12345\", it returns an empty slice. Then `ResolveWorkflow` prints the error \"could not find any workflows named 12345\". This matches the bug report perfectly.\n\nSo the fix is to use `strconv.ParseInt` instead of `strconv.Atoi`.\n\n```go\n// in FindWorkflow\nif _, err := strconv.ParseInt(workflowSelector, 10, 64); err == nil || isWorkflowFile(workflowSelector) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\nThis would correctly parse a 64-bit integer string.\n\nHowever, there's a subtlety. What if a workflow is named \"12345\"? The user might want to find it by name. But if we check for ID first, we might try to look up a workflow by an ID that doesn't exist.\n\nIf `getWorkflowByID` returns a \"not found\" error, maybe we should then try to search by name.\n\nLet's look at the proposed change from the PR. I don't have it, so I have to deduce it.\nThe issue is that numeric-like names are not being found.\n\nThe logic is:\n1. Try to parse as int. If it is an int, or it is a workflow file...\n2. Then get by ID. If this fails, it fails completely.\n3. Otherwise, get by name.\n\nThe problem is that `strconv.Atoi` can fail for large numbers that are valid int64 IDs.\nSo, changing `strconv.Atoi` to `strconv.ParseInt` with bit size 64 should fix it.\n\nLet's apply this change.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/strconv.Atoi/strconv.ParseInt(workflowSelector, 10, 64)/' cli/pkg/cmd/workflow/shared/shared.go\n```\nWait, `strconv.Atoi(workflowSelector)` returns two values, `_` and `err`. `strconv.ParseInt` also returns two values. But the first argument to `Atoi` is implicit.\nThe line is `if _, err := strconv.Atoi(workflowSelector); err == nil || isWorkflowFile(workflowSelector) {`.\nMy `sed` command would produce `if _, err := strconv.ParseInt(workflowSelector, 10, 64)(workflowSelector); ...`. That's wrong.\n\nI need to replace `strconv.Atoi(workflowSelector)` with `strconv.ParseInt(workflowSelector, 10, 64)`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/strconv.Atoi(workflowSelector)/strconv.ParseInt(workflowSelector, 10, 64)/' cli/pkg/cmd/workflow/shared/shared.go\n```\nThis seems correct. Let's check the line.\nLine 127: `if _, err := strconv.Atoi(workflowSelector); err == nil || isWorkflowFile(workflowSelector) {`\nAfter replacement: `if _, err := strconv.ParseInt(workflowSelector, 10, 64); err == nil || isWorkflowFile(workflowSelector) {`\nThis is syntactically correct and should fix the issue of large workflow IDs being misinterpreted as names.\n\nBut there's another problem. What if `getWorkflowByID` fails with a \"not found\" error? The user might have intended to search by name, but since the selector *looks* like an ID, we fail early.\n\nFrom another similar issue, I remember a change that was made. If `getWorkflowByID` fails, it checks if the error is a 404. If so, it ignores the error and proceeds to search by name.\n\nLet's look at `FindWorkflow` again.\n```go\nfunc FindWorkflow(client *api.Client, repo ghrepo.Interface, workflowSelector string, states []WorkflowState) ([]Workflow, error) {\n\tif workflowSelector == \"\" {\n\t\treturn nil, errors.New(\"empty workflow selector\")\n\t}\n\n\tif _, err := strconv.Atoi(workflowSelector); err == nil || isWorkflowFile(workflowSelector) {\n\t\tworkflow, err := getWorkflowByID(client, repo, workflowSelector)\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\treturn nil, err\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn []Workflow{*workflow}, nil\n\t}\n\n\treturn getWorkflowsByName(client, repo, workflowSelector, states)\n}\n```\nIf `getWorkflowByID` returns an error, we return `nil, err`. This is where the logic could be improved.\n\nA better logic would be:\n```go\nfunc FindWorkflow(client *api.Client, repo ghrepo.Interface, workflowSelector string, states []WorkflowState) ([]Workflow, error) {\n\tif workflowSelector == \"\" {\n\t\treturn nil, errors.New(\"empty workflow selector\")\n\t}\n\n\tisNum := false\n\tif _, err := strconv.ParseInt(workflowSelector, 10, 64); err == nil {\n\t\tisNum = true\n\t}\n\n\tif isNum || isWorkflowFile(workflowSelector) {\n\t\tworkflow, err := getWorkflowByID(client, repo, workflowSelector)\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tvar httpErr api.HTTPError\n\t\t\t// if it's a 404, maybe it's a workflow name that looks like an ID, so fall through\n\t\t\tif !errors.As(err, &httpErr) || httpErr.StatusCode != 404 {\n\t\t\t\treturn nil, err\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\treturn []Workflow{*workflow}, nil\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn getWorkflowsByName(client, repo, workflowSelector, states)\n}\n```\nThis is more complex to apply with `sed`.\n\nLet's look at the context of `FindWorkflow` again.\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /home/user/work/cli/pkg/cmd/workflow/shared/shared.go\nLines: 121-136\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n```bash\nnl -ba cli/pkg/cmd/workflow/shared/shared.go | sed -n '121,136p'\n```",
