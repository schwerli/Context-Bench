      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "THOUGHT:\nThe user wants to fix a security vulnerability where password reset tokens are not invalidated when a user's email address is changed.\nThe proposed solution is to include the user's email address in the hash for the password reset token.\nThe relevant file is `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py` and the method is `PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current implementation of `_make_hash_value`. I've inspected the file and found the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class. It inherits from `TokenGenerator`. The `_make_hash_value` method in `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` is what I need to modify.\n\nThe current implementation I've seen from my exploration is:\n```python\ndef _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):\n    \"\"\"\n    Hash of user's password salt and the timestamp\n    \"\"\"\n    return (\n        six.text_type(user.pk) + user.password + six.text_type(timestamp)\n    )\n```\nThis hash includes the user's primary key, password, and the timestamp. It does not include the email.\n\nTo fix the issue, I need to add the user's email to this hash.\nA simple `user.email` might not be robust enough for custom user models where the email field might have a different name.\nDjango's password reset mechanism uses `UserModel.EMAIL_FIELD` to identify the email field. I should do the same for consistency. The `user` object is available, so I can get the model class via `user.__class__` and then get the `EMAIL_FIELD` attribute from it.\n\nHowever, not all user models (e.g., those inheriting directly from `AbstractBaseUser`) are guaranteed to have an `EMAIL_FIELD`. The standard password reset form would fail for such models, but `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` could be used in other contexts. Therefore, my implementation should be defensive.\n\nI will use a `try...except AttributeError` block to get `user.__class__.EMAIL_FIELD`, falling back to the string `'email'` if it's not defined. This ensures backward compatibility and robustness.\n\nThen, I'll use `getattr(user, email_field, None)` to retrieve the email value. Using `None` as a default handles cases where the user model doesn't have an email field, or the field is not set. `six.text_type(None)` evaluates to the string `'None'`, which will work correctly in the hash. This correctly distinguishes between a `None` email and an empty string email, and invalidates tokens if the email status changes.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n1.  Create a `sed` script to replace the existing `_make_hash_value` method in `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`.\n2.  The new method will:\n    a. Determine the email field name by checking `user.__class__.EMAIL_FIELD`, with a fallback to `'email'`.\n    b. Get the user's email using `getattr`.\n    c. Include the email value in the returned hash tuple.\n    d. Update the docstring to reflect the change.\n3.  Execute the `sed` command to apply the change to the file.\n\nI've determined the line numbers for the method to be replaced are 87-93. I will now create the `sed` script and then apply it.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > replacement.sed\n87,93c\\\n    def _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        Hash of user's password salt, email and the timestamp\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        # The user's email address is now included in the hash to invalidate\\\n        # tokens if the email is changed.\\\n        try:\\\n            email_field = user.__class__.EMAIL_FIELD\\\n        except AttributeError:\\\n            email_field = 'email'\\\n        email = getattr(user, email_field, None)\\\n        return (\\\n            six.text_type(user.pk) + user.password +\\\n            six.text_type(timestamp) + six.text_type(email)\\\n        )\nEOF\n```",

                "content": "THOUGHT:\nThe user wants to fix a security vulnerability where password reset tokens are not invalidated when a user's email address is changed.\nThe proposed solution is to include the user's email address in the hash for the password reset token.\nThe relevant file is `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py` and the method is `PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current implementation of `_make_hash_value`. I've inspected the file and found the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class. It inherits from `TokenGenerator`. The `_make_hash_value` method in `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` is what I need to modify.\n\nThe current implementation I've seen from my exploration is:\n```python\ndef _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):\n    \"\"\"\n    Hash of user's password salt and the timestamp\n    \"\"\"\n    return (\n        six.text_type(user.pk) + user.password + six.text_type(timestamp)\n    )\n```\nThis hash includes the user's primary key, password, and the timestamp. It does not include the email.\n\nTo fix the issue, I need to add the user's email to this hash.\nA simple `user.email` might not be robust enough for custom user models where the email field might have a different name.\nDjango's password reset mechanism uses `UserModel.EMAIL_FIELD` to identify the email field. I should do the same for consistency. The `user` object is available, so I can get the model class via `user.__class__` and then get the `EMAIL_FIELD` attribute from it.\n\nHowever, not all user models (e.g., those inheriting directly from `AbstractBaseUser`) are guaranteed to have an `EMAIL_FIELD`. The standard password reset form would fail for such models, but `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` could be used in other contexts. Therefore, my implementation should be defensive.\n\nI will use a `try...except AttributeError` block to get `user.__class__.EMAIL_FIELD`, falling back to the string `'email'` if it's not defined. This ensures backward compatibility and robustness.\n\nThen, I'll use `getattr(user, email_field, None)` to retrieve the email value. Using `None` as a default handles cases where the user model doesn't have an email field, or the field is not set. `six.text_type(None)` evaluates to the string `'None'`, which will work correctly in the hash. This correctly distinguishes between a `None` email and an empty string email, and invalidates tokens if the email status changes.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n1.  Create a `sed` script to replace the existing `_make_hash_value` method in `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`.\n2.  The new method will:\n    a. Determine the email field name by checking `user.__class__.EMAIL_FIELD`, with a fallback to `'email'`.\n    b. Get the user's email using `getattr`.\n    c. Include the email value in the returned hash tuple.\n    d. Update the docstring to reflect the change.\n3.  Execute the `sed` command to apply the change to the file.\n\nI've determined the line numbers for the method to be replaced are 87-93. I will now create the `sed` script and then apply it.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > replacement.sed\n87,93c\\\n    def _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        Hash of user's password salt, email and the timestamp\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        # The user's email address is now included in the hash to invalidate\\\n        # tokens if the email is changed.\\\n        try:\\\n            email_field = user.__class__.EMAIL_FIELD\\\n        except AttributeError:\\\n            email_field = 'email'\\\n        email = getattr(user, email_field, None)\\\n        return (\\\n            six.text_type(user.pk) + user.password +\\\n            six.text_type(timestamp) + six.text_type(email)\\\n        )\nEOF\n```",
