      "content": "THOUGHT:\nThe user wants to fix an issue where `ds.Coarsen.construct` demotes non-dimensional coordinates to data variables.\nThe expected behavior is that all coordinates from the original object are preserved as coordinates in the new object.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The PR description's example is a bit confusing as it doesn't seem to demonstrate the issue with a non-dimensional coordinate. I'll construct my own minimal example to reproduce the bug.\n\nA non-dimensional coordinate is a scalar coordinate, one with no dimensions.\nLet's create a `Dataset` with a non-dimensional coordinate and see what happens.\n```python\nimport xarray as xr\nimport numpy as np\nda = xr.DataArray(np.arange(24), dims=[\"time\"])\nda = da.assign_coords(foo=\"bar\") # non-dimensional coordinate\nds = da.to_dataset(name=\"T\")\n# ds.coords contains 'foo'\nresult = ds.coarsen(time=12).construct(time=(\"year\", \"month\"))\n# In the result, 'foo' is a data variable, not a coordinate.\n```\nThis confirms the bug. `foo` was a coordinate but became a data variable.\n\nNow I need to find the code for `Coarsen.construct` and fix it.\nBased on the file structure, the relevant file is likely `xarray/core/coarsen.py`.\nI'll inspect this file. The `Coarsen` class has a `construct` method. `DatasetCoarsen` inherits from it and calls the parent's `construct` method. So the logic is in `Coarsen.construct`.\n\nInside `construct`, there's a helper function `reshape(variable)`. This function is applied to all data variables and coordinates.\nThe `variable` passed to `reshape` is a `DataArray`.\n\n```python\n# xarray/core/coarsen.py\ndef reshape(variable):\n    if dim in variable.dims:\n        # ... logic for reshaping ...\n        return variable.data.reshape(new_var_dims) # returns a numpy array\n    else:\n        return variable # returns a DataArray\n```\n\nFor a coordinate that contains the dimension being coarsened (e.g., `day(time)` in the PR's example), `dim in variable.dims` is true, and `reshape` returns a numpy array.\nFor a non-dimensional coordinate (e.g., my `foo`), it has no dimensions, so `dim in variable.dims` is false. `reshape` returns the original `DataArray` for `foo`.\n\nThe results from `reshape` are collected into `data_vars` and `coords` dictionaries, which are then used to initialize a new `Dataset`: `Dataset(data_vars, coords=coords, attrs=attrs)`.\n\nThe problem seems to stem from the inconsistency in return types from `reshape`. For variables that are reshaped, it returns a raw array. For variables that are not, it returns a `DataArray`. Passing a `DataArray` object inside the `coords` dictionary to the `Dataset` constructor might have unintended side effects, as `DataArray` objects themselves can carry coordinates.\n\nA more consistent approach would be for `reshape` to return either a raw array (for reshaped variables) or a `Variable` object (for variables that are not reshaped). This avoids passing `DataArray` objects into the constructor logic, which is meant to build a new `Dataset` from lower-level components.\n\nThe fix is to change the `else` branch in `reshape` to return `variable.variable` instead of `variable`.

                "content": "THOUGHT:\nThe user wants to fix an issue where `ds.Coarsen.construct` demotes non-dimensional coordinates to data variables.\nThe expected behavior is that all coordinates from the original object are preserved as coordinates in the new object.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The PR description's example is a bit confusing as it doesn't seem to demonstrate the issue with a non-dimensional coordinate. I'll construct my own minimal example to reproduce the bug.\n\nA non-dimensional coordinate is a scalar coordinate, one with no dimensions.\nLet's create a `Dataset` with a non-dimensional coordinate and see what happens.\n```python\nimport xarray as xr\nimport numpy as np\nda = xr.DataArray(np.arange(24), dims=[\"time\"])\nda = da.assign_coords(foo=\"bar\") # non-dimensional coordinate\nds = da.to_dataset(name=\"T\")\n# ds.coords contains 'foo'\nresult = ds.coarsen(time=12).construct(time=(\"year\", \"month\"))\n# In the result, 'foo' is a data variable, not a coordinate.\n```\nThis confirms the bug. `foo` was a coordinate but became a data variable.\n\nNow I need to find the code for `Coarsen.construct` and fix it.\nBased on the file structure, the relevant file is likely `xarray/core/coarsen.py`.\nI'll inspect this file. The `Coarsen` class has a `construct` method. `DatasetCoarsen` inherits from it and calls the parent's `construct` method. So the logic is in `Coarsen.construct`.\n\nInside `construct`, there's a helper function `reshape(variable)`. This function is applied to all data variables and coordinates.\nThe `variable` passed to `reshape` is a `DataArray`.\n\n```python\n# xarray/core/coarsen.py\ndef reshape(variable):\n    if dim in variable.dims:\n        # ... logic for reshaping ...\n        return variable.data.reshape(new_var_dims) # returns a numpy array\n    else:\n        return variable # returns a DataArray\n```\n\nFor a coordinate that contains the dimension being coarsened (e.g., `day(time)` in the PR's example), `dim in variable.dims` is true, and `reshape` returns a numpy array.\nFor a non-dimensional coordinate (e.g., my `foo`), it has no dimensions, so `dim in variable.dims` is false. `reshape` returns the original `DataArray` for `foo`.\n\nThe results from `reshape` are collected into `data_vars` and `coords` dictionaries, which are then used to initialize a new `Dataset`: `Dataset(data_vars, coords=coords, attrs=attrs)`.\n\nThe problem seems to stem from the inconsistency in return types from `reshape`. For variables that are reshaped, it returns a raw array. For variables that are not, it returns a `DataArray`. Passing a `DataArray` object inside the `coords` dictionary to the `Dataset` constructor might have unintended side effects, as `DataArray` objects themselves can carry coordinates.\n\nA more consistent approach would be for `reshape` to return either a raw array (for reshaped variables) or a `Variable` object (for variables that are not reshaped). This avoids passing `DataArray` objects into the constructor logic, which is meant to build a new `Dataset` from lower-level components.\n\nThe fix is to change the `else` branch in `reshape` to return `variable.variable` instead of `variable`. This extracts the underlying `Variable` object from the `DataArray`.\n\n```python\n# xarray/core/coarsen.py\ndef reshape(variable):\n    if dim in variable.dims:\n        # ...\n        return variable.data.reshape(new_var_dims)\n    else:\n        return variable.variable # The proposed change\n```\n\nThis change makes `reshape` return a `Variable` object for non-dimensional coordinates. This is a more fundamental object that the `Dataset` constructor can handle cleanly without ambiguity. The `Dataset` constructor will then correctly identify it as a coordinate because its name is in the `coords` dictionary.\n\nI will apply this change using `sed`.

My hypothesis is that for non-dimensional coordinates, the `reshape` function inside `construct` should return a `Variable` object instead of a `DataArray`. This can be achieved by changing `return variable` to `return variable.variable`.\n\nTo be sure I'm editing the correct line, I will first inspect the `construct` method in `xarray/core/coarsen.py`. I'll look at lines 130 to 180, which should contain the whole method.\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/xarray/core/coarsen.py\nLines: 130-180\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba xarray/core/coarsen.py | sed -n '130,180p'\n```",

My hypothesis is that for non-dimensional coordinates, the `reshape` function inside `construct` should return a `Variable` object instead of a `DataArray`. This can be achieved by changing `return variable` to `return variable.variable`.\n\nTo be sure I'm editing the correct line, I will first inspect the `construct` method in `xarray/core/coarsen.py`.

This suggests a new `Dataset` is being constructed, which is the core of the `construct` method's functionality.\n\nI will now inspect the code surrounding this line to understand the logic of the `construct` method for `Dataset` objects. I expect to find a loop that iterates over the variables of the original dataset, reshapes them, and then adds them to the new `reshaped` dataset. The bug likely lies in how non-dimensional coordinates are handled in this process.\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/xarray/core/rolling.py\nLines: 940-980\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba xarray/core/rolling.py | sed -n '940,980p'\n```",
