The logic is split into two main cases: `total_degree` (when `max_degrees` is an integer) and per-variable degrees (when `max_degrees` is a list). The bug is in the `total_degree` case.\n\nLet's analyze the `total_degree` block (lines 113-144).\nThe code handles commutative and non-commutative variables separately. The example uses commutative variables, so let's focus on lines 121-132.\n\n```python\n   121\t        if all(variable.is_commutative for variable in variables):\n   122\t            monomials_list_comm = []\n   123\t            for item in combinations_with_replacement(variables, max_degree):\n   124\t                powers = dict()\n   125\t                for variable in variables:\n   126\t                    powers[variable] = 0\n   127\t                for variable in item:\n   128\t                    if variable != 1:\n   129\t                        powers[variable] += 1\n   130\t                if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:\n   131\t                    monomials_list_comm.append(Mul(*item))\n   132\t            yield from set(monomials_list_comm)\n```\n\nThe problem is in line 130: `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:`.\n`powers` is a dictionary mapping each variable to its exponent in the monomial. `powers.values()` are the exponents of the variables. `max(powers.values())` is the maximum exponent of any single variable in the monomial.\nThe condition is checking if the *maximum exponent* is greater than or equal to `min_degree`.\nIt should be checking if the *total degree* of the monomial is greater than or equal to `min_degree`. The total degree is the sum of the exponents, which is `sum(powers.values())`.\n\nThe `combinations_with_replacement(variables, max_degree)` generates monomials of total degree *exactly* `max_degree`. The `variables` list is extended with `S.One` (line 120), so `combinations_with_replacement` will generate combinations that include `S.One`. The number of non-`S.One` variables in a combination corresponds to the total degree of the monomial.\n\nLet's trace `combinations_with_replacement(variables, max_degree)`.\n`variables` is `[x1, x2, x3, 1]`. `max_degree` is 3.\n`combinations_with_replacement` will give tuples of length 3.\ne.g., `(x1, x1, x1)` -> `x1**3`. `powers` will be `{x1: 3, x2: 0, x3: 0, 1: 0}`. `max(powers.values())` is 3. `min_degree` is 3. `3 >= 3` is true. `x1**3` is included.\ne.g., `(x1, x2, x3)` -> `x1*x2*x3`. `powers` will be `{x1: 1, x2: 1, x3: 1, 1: 0}`. `max(powers.values())` is 1. `min_degree` is 3. `1 >= 3` is false. `x1*x2*x3` is excluded. This is wrong.\n\nThe total degree of a monomial is `sum(powers.values())`.\nThe code should be checking `if sum(powers.values()) >= min_degree:`.\n\nHowever, there's another issue. The loop `for item in combinations_with_replacement(variables, max_degree):` generates monomials of total degree *up to* `max_degree`, not just *equal to* `max_degree`. This is because `S.One` is added to `variables`. For example, `(x1, S.One, S.One)` corresponds to monomial `x1`, which has total degree 1.\n\nLet's re-read the logic.\n`variables` is extended with `S.One` (line 120).\n`combinations_with_replacement(variables, max_degree)` is called. This generates combinations of length `max_degree`.\nFor each combination `item`, `Mul(*item)` is formed.\nIf `item` is `(x1, x1, S.One)`, `Mul(*item)` is `x1**2`. The total degree is 2.\nThe number of elements in `item` that are not `S.One` is the total degree.\n\nSo, `sum(powers.values())` is indeed the total degree.\nThe condition `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:` is incorrect. It should be `if sum(powers.values()) >= min_degree:`.\n\nLet's check the non-commutative case as well (lines 133-144).\n```python\n   133\t        else:\n   134\t            monomials_list_non_comm = []\n   135\t            for item in product(variables, repeat=max_degree):\n   136\t                powers = dict()\n   137\t                for variable in variables:\n   138\t                    powers[variable] = 0\n   139\t                for variable in item:\n   140\t                    if variable != 1:\n   141\t                        powers[variable] += 1\n   142\t                if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:\n   143\t                    monomials_list_non_comm.append(Mul(*item))\n   144\t            yield from set(monomials_list_non_comm)\n```\nIt has the exact same bug on line 142: `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:`. It should also be `sum(powers.values())`.\n\nSo I need to change `max(powers.values())` to `sum(powers.values())` in two places.\n\nLine 130: `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:` -> `if sum(powers.values()) >= min_degree:`\nLine 142: `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:` -> `if sum(powers.values()) >= min_degree:`\n\nLet's check the logic for generating monomials.\n`variables` is `[x1, x2, x3]`. `max_degrees` is 3, `min_degrees` is 3.\n`variables` becomes `[x1, x2, x3, 1]`.\n`combinations_with_replacement([x1, x2, x3, 1], 3)` will generate combinations.\n- `(x1, x1, x1)` -> `x1**3`. `powers` is `{x1:3, ...}`. `sum` is 3. `3 >= 3` is true. OK.\n- `(x1, x1, x2)` -> `x1**2*x2`. `powers` is `{x1:2, x2:1, ...}`. `sum` is 3. `3 >= 3` is true. OK.\n- `(x1, x1, 1)` -> `x1**2`. `powers` is `{x1:2, ...}`. `sum` is 2. `2 >= 3` is false. OK.\n- `(1, 1, 1)` -> `1`. `powers` is `{...}`. `sum` is 0. `0 >= 3` is false. OK.\n\nThis seems correct. The logic of adding `S.One` and using `combinations_with_replacement` of length `max_degree` is a way to generate all monomials of total degree *up to* `max_degree`. Then the `min_degree` is used for filtering.\n\nThe problem description says:\n> The monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n\nLet's test this case. `max_degrees=4`, `min_degrees=3`.\nThe loop `combinations_with_replacement(variables, 4)` will generate monomials up to degree 4.\nThe condition `sum(powers.values()) >= 3` will correctly filter for monomials of degree 3 and 4.\nThis seems to fix that issue as well.\n\nSo, the fix is to replace `max` with `sum`.\n\nI will now apply the changes using `sed`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '130s/max(powers.values())/sum(powers.values())/' sympy/polys/monomials.py && sed -i '142s/max(powers.values())/sum(powers.values())/' sympy/polys/monomials.py\n```",

OK.\n- `(x1, x1, x2)` -> `x1**2*x2`. `powers` is `{x1:2, x2:1, ...}`. `sum` is 3. `3 >= 3` is true. OK.\n- `(x1, x1, 1)` -> `x1**2`. `powers` is `{x1:2, ...}`. `sum` is 2. `2 >= 3` is false. OK.\n- `(1, 1, 1)` -> `1`. `powers` is `{...}`. `sum` is 0. `0 >= 3` is false. OK.\n\nThis seems correct. The logic of adding `S.One` and using `combinations_with_replacement` of length `max_degree` is a way to generate all monomials of total degree *up to* `max_degree`. Then the `min_degree` is used for filtering.\n\nThe problem description says:\n> The monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n\nLet's test this case. `max_degrees=4`, `min_degrees=3`.\nThe loop `combinations_with_replacement(variables, 4)` will generate monomials up to degree 4.\nThe condition `sum(powers.values()) >= 3` will correctly filter for monomials of degree 3 and 4.\nThis seems to fix that issue as well.\n\nSo, the fix is to replace `max` with `sum`.\n\nI will now apply the changes using `sed`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '130s/max(powers.values())/sum(powers.values())/' sympy/polys/monomials.py && sed -i '142s/max(powers.values())/sum(powers.values())/' sympy/polys/monomials.py\n```",
