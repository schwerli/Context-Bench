Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.py\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.py | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.py\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.py\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.py | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.py | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

I think it's due to a change in the return value of timezone._get_timezone_name() that's called by the TimezoneMixin.\nOn Django 3.1 the TimezoneMixin method get_tzname() returns \"+10\" for a \"Etc/GMT-10\" time zone after calling \u200b_get_timezone_name(). This later becomes \"-10\" in the resulting query due to the return value of _prepare_tzname_delta() of the Postgres DatabaseOperations class, i.e. the time zone 10 hours east from UTC.\nSELECT ...

This later, incorrectly, becomes \"Etc/GMT+10\" in the resulting query due to the return value of _prepare_tzname_delta() of the Postgres DatabaseOperations class, i.e. the time zone 10 hours west from UTC, which is the opposite direction from the behavior in Django 3.1.\nSELECT ...

For a time zone like `Etc/GMT-10`, it replaces the `-` with a `+`, resulting in `Etc/GMT+10`.\n\nThe PR description says:\n> On Django 3.1 the TimezoneMixin method get_tzname() returns \"+10\" for a \"Etc/GMT-10\" time zone after calling \u200b_get_timezone_name(). This later becomes \"-10\" in the resulting query due to the return value of _prepare_tzname_delta() of the Postgres DatabaseOperations class, i.e. the time zone 10 hours east from UTC.\n\n> On Django 3.2 the TimezoneMixin method get_tzname() returns \"Etc/GMT-10\" for a \"Etc/GMT-10\" time zone after calling \u200b_get_timezone_name(). This later, incorrectly, becomes \"Etc/GMT+10\" in the resulting query...\n\nSo, in Django 3.1, `_get_timezone_name` returned a numeric offset like `+10`. `_prepare_tzname_delta` would then convert it to `-10`. This seems to be related to how PostgreSQL handles time zones. A `+` offset in a timezone name means west of UTC, while a `-` offset means east of UTC. So `Etc/GMT-10` is 10 hours ahead of UTC (east), which corresponds to a POSIX-style timezone offset of `+10`. PostgreSQL's `AT TIME ZONE` seems to expect the opposite for numeric offsets.\n\nHowever, for named time zones like `Etc/GMT-10`, PostgreSQL understands them directly and no sign flipping is needed. The problem is that `_prepare_tzname_delta` is too aggressive and flips the sign even for these named time zones.\n\nThe fix should be to prevent this sign flipping for `Etc/GMT...` time zones. I can add a check to see if `tzname` starts with `Etc/GMT`. If it does, I should return it as is.\n\nSo, the logic should be:\n1. If `tzname` starts with `Etc/GMT`, return `tzname` without modification.\n2. Otherwise, perform the existing sign-flipping logic.\n\nLet's modify the file.\n\n```python\ndef _prepare_tzname_delta(self, tzname):\n    if tzname.startswith('Etc/GMT'):\n        return tzname\n    if '+' in tzname:\n        return tzname.replace('+', '-')\n    elif '-' in tzname:\n        return tzname.replace('-', '+')\n    return tzname\n```\n\nThis looks correct.

      "content": "THOUGHT\nOkay, `Trunc` is in `django/db/models/functions/datetime.py`. It's a database function.\n\nI'll write a script to reproduce the issue. I need to:\n1.  Set up a minimal Django environment. This involves setting `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` and configuring some basic settings like `DATABASES` and `INSTALLED_APPS`.\n2.  Define a model with a `DateTimeField`.\n3.  Use `Trunc` with a `pytz` or `zoneinfo` timezone object for `Etc/GMT-10`.\n4.  Get the query from the queryset and check the generated SQL.\n\nHere's a plan for the script `repro.py`:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Configure Django settings\nos.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'repro_settings')\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models, connection\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Trunc\nfrom django.apps import apps\nfrom django.apps.config import AppConfig\n\n# Use pytz if available, otherwise zoneinfo\ntry:\n    import pytz\n    def get_tz(name):\n        return pytz.timezone(name)\nexcept ImportError:\n    from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo\n    def get_tz(name):\n        return ZoneInfo(name)\n\n# Minimal Django settings for the test\nsettings.configure(\n    DATABASES={\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',\n            'NAME': 'test',\n            'USER': 'test',\n            'PASSWORD': 'test',\n            'HOST': 'localhost',\n            'PORT': '5432',\n        }\n    },\n    INSTALLED_APPS=[\n        'repro',\n    ],\n    USE_TZ=True,\n    TIME_ZONE='UTC',\n)\n\n# Minimal AppConfig\nclass ReproAppConfig(AppConfig):\n    name = 'repro'\n    models_module = 'repro'\n\n# Minimal model\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    start_at = models.DateTimeField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'repro'\n\n# Register the app and model\nsys.modules['repro'] = sys.modules[__name__]\napps.populate(['repro'])\n\ndef run_test():\n    # The timezone from the PR description\n    tz = get_tz(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\n\n    # Create a queryset with Trunc\n    qs = MyModel.objects.annotate(\n        date=Trunc('start_at', 'day', tzinfo=tz)\n    )\n\n    # Get the SQL query\n    query = str(qs.query)\n    print(query)\n\n    # Check if the SQL is correct\n    if \"AT TIME ZONE 'Etc/GMT-10'\" in query:\n        print(\"FIX VERIFIED: SQL is correct.\")\n    elif \"AT TIME ZONE 'Etc/GMT+10'\" in query:\n        print(\"BUG REPRODUCED: SQL is incorrect.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"UNKNOWN: Could not determine if fix is working from SQL.\")\n        print(\"Generated SQL did not contain expected timezone string.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    run_test()\n```\n\nThis script is a bit complex to write with `cat << EOF`. I'll try to simplify it. I don't need to run migrations or connect to a real database. I just need to compile the query to SQL. `connection.ops.compiler('SQLCompiler')` can be used for this.\n\nLet's try a simpler script.\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'my_settings')\n\nfrom django.conf import settings\nsettings.configure(\n    DATABASES={\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',\n        }\n    },\n    USE_TZ=True,\n)\n\nimport django\ndjango.setup()\n\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Trunc\n\ntry:\n    import pytz\n    tz = pytz.timezone(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\nexcept ImportError:\n    from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo\n    tz = ZoneInfo(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\n\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    start_at = models.DateTimeField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\n\nqs = MyModel.objects.annotate(\n    date=Trunc('start_at', 'day', tzinfo=tz)\n)\n\nprint(str(qs.query))\n```\n\nThis is better. I'll create this file as `repro.py`. I'll need to create a dummy `my_settings.py` as well, or just configure it inline. The inline configuration is better. I'll also need to install `pytz` if it's not there. The PR description says it works with `zoneinfo` too, which is in the standard library since Python 3.9. I'll assume one of them is available.\n\nLet's create the `repro.py` file.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > repro.py\nimport os\nos.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', __name__)\n\nfrom django.conf import settings\nsettings.configure(\n    DATABASES={\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',\n            'NAME': 'db',\n        }\n    },\n    USE_TZ=True,\n    SECRET_KEY='dummy',\n    INSTALLED_APPS=['django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.auth', 'repro_app']\n)\n\nimport django\ndjango.setup()\n\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Trunc\n\ntry:\n    import pytz\n    tz = pytz.timezone(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\nexcept ImportError:\n    from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo\n    tz = ZoneInfo(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\n\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    start_at = models.DateTimeField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'repro_app'\n\n\nqs = MyModel.objects.annotate(\n    date=Trunc('start_at', 'day', tzinfo=tz)\n)\n\nsql, params = qs.query.sql_with_params()\nprint(sql)\n\nif \"AT TIME ZONE 'Etc/GMT-10'\" in sql:\n    print(\"SUCCESS: Fix is working.\")\nelif \"AT TIME ZONE 'Etc/GMT+10'\" in sql:\n    print(\"FAILURE: Bug is present.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"UNKNOWN: Could not determine if fix is working from SQL.\")\n\nEOF\n```\nI need an app for the model. I'll create a dummy app structure.\n\n```bash\nmkdir repro_app\ntouch repro_app/__init__.py\ncat <<'EOF' > repro_app/models.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    start_at = models.DateTimeField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'repro_app'\nEOF\n```\nThis seems too complicated. The second script I wrote was simpler. It didn't need `INSTALLED_APPS` or `django.setup()`. Let me re-check. `django.setup()` is needed if you're running a standalone script. And for models to be recognized, they need to be in an installed app.\n\nLet's try to simplify the setup. I can define the model inside the script and then manually install the app.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > repro.py\nimport os\nimport sys\n\n# Add current directory to path to allow importing models.\nsys.path.append(os.path.abspath('.'))\n\nos.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'settings')\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\n# Define a minimal set of settings.\nsettings.configure(\n    SECRET_KEY='a-secret-key',\n    DATABASES={\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',\n            'NAME': 'testdb',\n        }\n    },\n    INSTALLED_APPS=[\n        'django.contrib.auth',\n        'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n        'repro_app',\n    ],\n    USE_TZ=True,\n)\n\nimport django\ndjango.setup()\n\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Trunc\nfrom repro_app.models import MyModel\n\ntry:\n    import pytz\n    tz = pytz.timezone(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\nexcept ImportError:\n    from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo\n    tz = ZoneInfo(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\n\nqs = MyModel.objects.annotate(\n    date=Trunc('start_at', 'day', tzinfo=tz)\n)\n\nsql = str(qs.query)\n\nprint(sql)\n\nif \"AT TIME ZONE 'Etc/GMT-10'\" in sql:\n    print(\"SUCCESS: Fix is working.\")\nelif \"AT TIME ZONE 'Etc/GMT+10'\" in sql:\n    print(\"FAILURE: Bug is present.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"UNKNOWN: Could not determine if fix is working from SQL.\")\nEOF\n\nmkdir -p repro_app\ntouch repro_app/__init__.py\ncat <<'EOF' > repro_app/models.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    start_at = models.DateTimeField()\nEOF\n```\nThis seems like a reasonable setup.

I'll run this as two separate commands. First create the app structure, then the repro script.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p repro_app && touch repro_app/__init__.py && cat <<'EOF' > repro_app/models.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    start_at = models.DateTimeField()\nEOF\n```",

Get the query from the queryset and check the generated SQL.\n\nHere's a plan for the script `repro.py`:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Configure Django settings\nos.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'repro_settings')\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models, connection\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Trunc\nfrom django.apps import apps\nfrom django.apps.config import AppConfig\n\n# Use pytz if available, otherwise zoneinfo\ntry:\n    import pytz\n    def get_tz(name):\n        return pytz.timezone(name)\nexcept ImportError:\n    from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo\n    def get_tz(name):\n        return ZoneInfo(name)\n\n# Minimal Django settings for the test\nsettings.configure(\n    DATABASES={\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',\n            'NAME': 'test',\n            'USER': 'test',\n            'PASSWORD': 'test',\n            'HOST': 'localhost',\n            'PORT': '5432',\n        }\n    },\n    INSTALLED_APPS=[\n        'repro',\n    ],\n    USE_TZ=True,\n    TIME_ZONE='UTC',\n)\n\n# Minimal AppConfig\nclass ReproAppConfig(AppConfig):\n    name = 'repro'\n    models_module = 'repro'\n\n# Minimal model\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    start_at = models.DateTimeField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'repro'\n\n# Register the app and model\nsys.modules['repro'] = sys.modules[__name__]\napps.populate(['repro'])\n\ndef run_test():\n    # The timezone from the PR description\n    tz = get_tz(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\n\n    # Create a queryset with Trunc\n    qs = MyModel.objects.annotate(\n        date=Trunc('start_at', 'day', tzinfo=tz)\n    )\n\n    # Get the SQL query\n    query = str(qs.query)\n    print(query)\n\n    # Check if the SQL is correct\n    if \"AT TIME ZONE 'Etc/GMT-10'\" in query:\n        print(\"FIX VERIFIED: SQL is correct.\")\n    elif \"AT TIME ZONE 'Etc/GMT+10'\" in query:\n        print(\"BUG REPRODUCED: SQL is incorrect.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"UNKNOWN: Could not determine if fix is working from SQL.\")\n        print(\"Generated SQL did not contain expected timezone string.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    run_test()\n```\n\nThis script is a bit complex to write with `cat << EOF`. I'll try to simplify it. I don't need to run migrations or connect to a real database. I just need to compile the query to SQL. `connection.ops.compiler('SQLCompiler')` can be used for this.\n\nLet's try a simpler script.\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'my_settings')\n\nfrom django.conf import settings\nsettings.configure(\n    DATABASES={\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',\n        }\n    },\n    USE_TZ=True,\n)\n\nimport django\ndjango.setup()\n\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Trunc\n\ntry:\n    import pytz\n    tz = pytz.timezone(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\nexcept ImportError:\n    from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo\n    tz = ZoneInfo(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\n\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    start_at = models.DateTimeField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\n\nqs = MyModel.objects.annotate(\n    date=Trunc('start_at', 'day', tzinfo=tz)\n)\n\nprint(str(qs.query))\n```\n\nThis is better. I'll create this file as `repro.py`. I'll need to create a dummy `my_settings.py` as well, or just configure it inline. The inline configuration is better. I'll also need to install `pytz` if it's not there. The PR description says it works with `zoneinfo` too, which is in the standard library since Python 3.9. I'll assume one of them is available.\n\nLet's create the `repro.py` file.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > repro.py\nimport os\nos.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', __name__)\n\nfrom django.conf import settings\nsettings.configure(\n    DATABASES={\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',\n            'NAME': 'db',\n        }\n    },\n    USE_TZ=True,\n    SECRET_KEY='dummy',\n    INSTALLED_APPS=['django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.auth', 'repro_app']\n)\n\nimport django\ndjango.setup()\n\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Trunc\n\ntry:\n    import pytz\n    tz = pytz.timezone(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\nexcept ImportError:\n    from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo\n    tz = ZoneInfo(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\n\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    start_at = models.DateTimeField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'repro_app'\n\n\nqs = MyModel.objects.annotate(\n    date=Trunc('start_at', 'day', tzinfo=tz)\n)\n\nsql, params = qs.query.sql_with_params()\nprint(sql)\n\nif \"AT TIME ZONE 'Etc/GMT-10'\" in sql:\n    print(\"SUCCESS: Fix is working.\")\nelif \"AT TIME ZONE 'Etc/GMT+10'\" in sql:\n    print(\"FAILURE: Bug is present.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"UNKNOWN: Could not determine if fix is working from SQL.\")\n\nEOF\n```\nI need an app for the model. I'll create a dummy app structure.\n\n```bash\nmkdir repro_app\ntouch repro_app/__init__.py\ncat <<'EOF' > repro_app/models.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    start_at = models.DateTimeField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'repro_app'\nEOF\n```\nThis seems too complicated. The second script I wrote was simpler. It didn't need `INSTALLED_APPS` or `django.setup()`. Let me re-check. `django.setup()` is needed if you're running a standalone script. And for models to be recognized, they need to be in an installed app.\n\nLet's try to simplify the setup. I can define the model inside the script and then manually install the app.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > repro.py\nimport os\nimport sys\n\n# Add current directory to path to allow importing models.\nsys.path.append(os.path.abspath('.'))\n\nos.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'settings')\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\n# Define a minimal set of settings.\nsettings.configure(\n    SECRET_KEY='a-secret-key',\n    DATABASES={\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',\n            'NAME': 'testdb',\n        }\n    },\n    INSTALLED_APPS=[\n        'django.contrib.auth',\n        'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n        'repro_app',\n    ],\n    USE_TZ=True,\n)\n\nimport django\ndjango.setup()\n\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Trunc\nfrom repro_app.models import MyModel\n\ntry:\n    import pytz\n    tz = pytz.timezone(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\nexcept ImportError:\n    from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo\n    tz = ZoneInfo(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\n\nqs = MyModel.objects.annotate(\n    date=Trunc('start_at', 'day', tzinfo=tz)\n)\n\nsql = str(qs.query)\n\nprint(sql)\n\nif \"AT TIME ZONE 'Etc/GMT-10'\" in sql:\n    print(\"SUCCESS: Fix is working.\")\nelif \"AT TIME ZONE 'Etc/GMT+10'\" in sql:\n    print(\"FAILURE: Bug is present.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"UNKNOWN: Could not determine if fix is working from SQL.\")\nEOF\n\nmkdir -p repro_app\ntouch repro_app/__init__.py\ncat <<'EOF' > repro_app/models.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    start_at = models.DateTimeField()\nEOF\n```\nThis seems like a reasonable setup. I'll execute this. I'll combine them into one command.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p repro_app && \\\ntouch repro_app/__init__.py && \\\ncat <<'EOF' > repro_app/models.py && \\\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    start_at = models.DateTimeField()\nEOF\ncat <<'EOF' > repro.py\nimport os\nimport sys\n\n# Add current directory to path to allow importing models.\nsys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))\n\nos.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'settings')\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\n# Define a minimal set of settings.\nsettings.configure(\n    SECRET_KEY='a-secret-key',\n    DATABASES={\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',\n            'NAME': 'testdb',\n        }\n    },\n    INSTALLED_APPS=[\n        'django.contrib.auth',\n        'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n        'repro_app',\n    ],\n    USE_TZ=True,\n)\n\nimport django\ndjango.setup()\n\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Trunc\nfrom repro_app.models import MyModel\n\ntry:\n    import pytz\n    tz = pytz.timezone(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\nexcept ImportError:\n    from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo\n    tz = ZoneInfo(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\n\nqs = MyModel.objects.annotate(\n    date=Trunc('start_at', 'day', tzinfo=tz)\n)\n\nsql = str(qs.query)\n\nprint(sql)\n\nif \"AT TIME ZONE 'Etc/GMT-10'\" in sql:\n    print(\"SUCCESS: Fix is working.\")\nelif \"AT TIME ZONE 'Etc/GMT+10'\" in sql:\n    print(\"FAILURE: Bug is present.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"UNKNOWN: Could not determine if fix is working from SQL.\")\nEOF\n```\nThe `repro_app/models.py` creation is messed up. Let me fix it.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p repro_app && \\\ntouch repro_app/__init__.py && \\\ncat <<'EOF' > repro_app/models.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    start_at = models.DateTimeField()\nEOF\n\ncat <<'EOF' > repro.py\nimport os\nimport sys\n\n# Add current directory to path to allow importing models.\nsys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))\n\nos.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'settings')\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\n# Define a minimal set of settings.\nsettings.configure(\n    SECRET_KEY='a-secret-key',\n    DATABASES={\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',\n            'NAME': 'testdb',\n        }\n    },\n    INSTALLED_APPS=[\n        'django.contrib.auth',\n        'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n        'repro_app',\n    ],\n    USE_TZ=True,\n)\n\nimport django\ndjango.setup()\n\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Trunc\nfrom repro_app.models import MyModel\n\ntry:\n    import pytz\n    tz = pytz.timezone(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\nexcept ImportError:\n    from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo\n    tz = ZoneInfo(\"Etc/GMT-10\")\n\nqs = MyModel.objects.annotate(\n    date=Trunc('start_at', 'day', tzinfo=tz)\n)\n\nsql = str(qs.query)\n\nprint(sql)\n\nif \"AT TIME ZONE 'Etc/GMT-10'\" in sql:\n    print(\"SUCCESS: Fix is working.\")\nelif \"AT TIME ZONE 'Etc/GMT+10'\" in sql:\n    print(\"FAILURE: Bug is present.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"UNKNOWN: Could not determine if fix is working from SQL.\")\nEOF\n```\nThis looks better. I'll run this as two separate commands. First create the app structure, then the repro script.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p repro_app && touch repro_app/__init__.py && cat <<'EOF' > repro_app/models.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    start_at = models.DateTimeField()\nEOF\n```",
