Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.py\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.py | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.py\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.py\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.py | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.py | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

      "content": "THOUGHT:\nI've reviewed the code in `django/utils/decorators.py`.\n\nThe relevant functions are `method_decorator` and `_multi_decorate`.\n\nLooking at `_multi_decorate`, I see this line:\n`bound_method = partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))`\n\nThis creates a `functools.partial` object. The PR description says: \"the function that is passed to the decorator is a partial object and does not have any of the attributes expected from a function i.e. `__name__`, `__module__` etc...\". This seems to be the root cause.\n\nThe `partial` object `bound_method` is then passed to the decorators:\n`bound_method = dec(bound_method)`\n\nThe decorator `logger` from the example then wraps this `partial` object. When `logger`'s inner function tries to access `func.__name__` (where `func` is the `partial` object), it fails.\n\nThe fix should be to make sure that the `partial` object has the necessary attributes from the original method. `functools.update_wrapper` can be used for this.\n\nI can add `update_wrapper(bound_method, method)` right after `bound_method` is created.\n\nLet's look at `_multi_decorate` again.\n```python\ndef _multi_decorate(decorators, method):\n    \"\"\"\n    Decorate `method` with one or more function decorators. `decorators` can be\n    a single decorator or an iterable of decorators.\n    \"\"\"\n    if hasattr(decorators, '__iter__'):\n        # Apply a list/tuple of decorators if 'decorators' is one. Decorator\n        # functions are applied so that the call order is the same as the\n        # order in which they appear in the iterable.\n        decorators = decorators[::-1]\n    else:\n        decorators = [decorators]\n\n    def _wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # bound_method has the signature that 'decorator' expects i.e. no\n        # 'self' argument, but it's a closure over self so it can call\n        # 'func'.

The problem is that `bound_method` is a `partial` and doesn't have `__name__` etc. The decorators are applied to `bound_method`.\n\nThe fix should be to copy the attributes from `method` to `bound_method`.\n\nSo, inside `_wrapper`, after `bound_method` is created:\n```python\ndef _wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\n    bound_method = partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))\n    # This is where the fix should go.\n    update_wrapper(bound_method, method) # <-- This should do it.\n    for dec in decorators:\n        bound_method = dec(bound_method)\n    return bound_method(*args, **kwargs)\n```\n\nLet's verify this. `functools.partial` objects don't have `__name__` by default, but `update_wrapper` can assign to `__name__`, `__module__`, `__doc__`, and `__dict__`. `partial` objects have a `__dict__` so this should work.\n\nBefore I apply the fix, I'll create a file to reproduce the error. I'll call it `repro.py`.\n\n```python\n# repro.py\nimport logging\nfrom functools import wraps, partial\nfrom django.utils.decorators import method_decorator\n\n# Mock logger\nclass MockLogger:\n    def debug(self, msg):\n        print(f\"DEBUG: {msg}\")\n\nlogger = MockLogger()\n\n# The decorator from the PR description\ndef log_decorator(func):\n    @wraps(func)\n    def inner(*args, **kwargs):\n        try:\n            result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        except Exception as e:\n            result = str(e)\n        finally:\n            # This line causes the error\n            logger.debug(f\"{func.__name__} called with args: {args} and kwargs: {kwargs} resulting: {result}\")\n    return inner\n\nclass Test:\n    @method_decorator(log_decorator)\n    def hello_world(self):\n        return \"hello\"\n\n# To run this, we need to set up a minimal Django environment\n# so that django.utils.decorators can be imported.\n# I'll just run it and see what happens.

The problem is that `bound_method` is a `partial` and doesn't have `__name__` etc. The decorators are applied to `bound_method`.\n\nThe fix should be to copy the attributes from `method` to `bound_method`.\n\nSo, inside `_wrapper`, after `bound_method` is created:\n```python\ndef _wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\n    bound_method = partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))\n    # This is where the fix should go.\n    update_wrapper(bound_method, method) # <-- This should do it.\n    for dec in decorators:\n        bound_method = dec(bound_method)\n    return bound_method(*args, **kwargs)\n```\n\nLet's verify this. `functools.partial` objects don't have `__name__` by default, but `update_wrapper` can assign to `__name__`, `__module__`, `__doc__`, and `__dict__`. `partial` objects have a `__dict__` so this should work.\n\nBefore I apply the fix, I'll create a file to reproduce the error. I'll call it `repro.py`.\n\n```python\n# repro.py\nimport logging\nfrom functools import wraps, partial\nfrom django.utils.decorators import method_decorator\n\n# Mock logger\nclass MockLogger:\n    def debug(self, msg):\n        print(f\"DEBUG: {msg}\")\n\nlogger = MockLogger()\n\n# The decorator from the PR description\ndef log_decorator(func):\n    @wraps(func)\n    def inner(*args, **kwargs):\n        try:\n            result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        except Exception as e:\n            result = str(e)\n        finally:\n            # This line causes the error\n            logger.debug(f\"{func.__name__} called with args: {args} and kwargs: {kwargs} resulting: {result}\")\n    return inner\n\nclass Test:\n    @method_decorator(log_decorator)\n    def hello_world(self):\n        return \"hello\"\n\n# To run this, we need to set up a minimal Django environment\n# so that django.utils.decorators can be imported.\n# I'll just run it and see what happens. It will probably complain about settings.\n# I'll create a dummy settings file.\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Need to configure Django settings to be able to import its components\n    from django.conf import settings\n    import os\n    if not settings.configured:\n        settings.configure(\n            SECRET_KEY='a-secret-key',\n        )\n    \n    print(\"Instantiating Test class and calling hello_world...\")\n    t = Test()\n    t.hello_world()\n    print(\"Done.\")\n\n```\n\nI'll create this file. I need to be careful with the imports. The `django` module is in the current directory.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > repro.py\nimport sys\nimport os\n\n# Add current directory to path to find 'django'\nsys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))\n\nfrom functools import wraps\nfrom django.utils.decorators import method_decorator\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\n# Configure minimal settings for Django to work\nif not settings.configured:\n    settings.configure(\n        SECRET_KEY='a-secret-key',\n    )\n\n# Mock logger\nclass MockLogger:\n    def debug(self, msg):\n        print(f\"DEBUG: {msg}\")\n\nlogger = MockLogger()\n\n# The decorator from the PR description\ndef log_decorator(func):\n    @wraps(func)\n    def inner(*args, **kwargs):\n        try:\n            result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        except Exception as e:\n            result = str(e)\n        finally:\n            # This line causes the error\n            logger.debug(f\"{func.__name__} called with args: {args} and kwargs: {kwargs} resulting: {result}\")\n    return inner\n\nclass Test:\n    @method_decorator(log_decorator)\n    def hello_world(self):\n        return \"hello\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print(\"Instantiating Test class and calling hello_world...\")\n    t = Test()\n    t.hello_world()\n    print(\"Done.\")\nEOF\n```",
