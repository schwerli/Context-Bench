      "content": "THOUGHT:\nThe user wants to fix an issue with `lambdify(modules='mpmath')` where `Rational` numbers are not wrapped correctly, leading to precision loss.\nThe example provided is `Eq(rf(18,x), 77 + S(1)/3)`. The term `77 + S(1)/3` is a SymPy `Rational` `232/3`. When lambdified with the `mpmath` module, it becomes `232/3` in the generated Python code. This is standard Python division, which uses floating-point arithmetic and loses precision.\n\nTo fix this, I need to modify how `lambdify` translates `Rational` numbers when the `mpmath` module is specified.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the code responsible for translating SymPy expressions for `lambdify` with `mpmath`.\n2.  Find how `Rational` numbers are currently handled.\n3.  Modify the handling of `Rational` numbers to produce `mpmath`-compatible code that preserves precision.\n4.  Verify the fix.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the translation code**\nThe PR description and my initial analysis suggest that `lambdify` uses a printer system. For `modules='mpmath'`, it seems to use a specific printer. A quick search in the codebase for `lambdify` and `mpmath` would point to `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py`. Inside this file, I can see that if `modules == 'mpmath'`, it uses `sympy.printing.mpmath.mpmath_printer`. This printer is an instance of `MpmathPrinter` from `sympy/printing/mpmath.py`.\n\n**Step 2: Current handling of `Rational`**\nThe `MpmathPrinter` inherits from `LambdaPrinter` (`sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py`). I'll check if `MpmathPrinter` has a method for printing rationals, e.g., `_print_Rational`. If not, it will use the one from `LambdaPrinter`.\nA check reveals `MpmathPrinter` does not have `_print_Rational`. `LambdaPrinter` has `_print_Rational`, which returns `'{}/{}'.format(expr.p, expr.q)`. This is the source of the problem, as it generates Python code for standard float division.\n\n**Step 3: Modify the handling of `Rational`**\nTo fix this, I need to add a `_print_Rational` method to `MpmathPrinter` in `sympy/printing/mpmath.py`. This new method should generate code that uses `mpmath`'s arbitrary-precision floating-point numbers.\nLooking at `_print_Float` in `MpmathPrinter`, it generates `mpf('%s')`. This is a good pattern. For a rational `p/q`, I can generate `mpf(p)/q`. `mpmath` will handle the division of an `mpf` object by an integer with full precision.\nSo, I will add the following method to `MpmathPrinter`:\n```python\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\n        return \"mpf(%s)/%s\" % (e.p, e.q)\n```\nThis will produce code like `mpf(232)/3`, which will be correctly evaluated by `mpmath`.\n\n**Step 4: Verification**\nI created a test script `reproduce_issue.py` to confirm the issue and will use it to verify the fix. After applying the change, I'll run the script again. The generated source code for the lambdified function should now contain `mpf(232)/3`, and the numerical result from `nsolve` should be more accurate, matching the expected high-precision value of 77 + 1/3.\n\nI will now apply the change using `sed`. I'll add the `_print_Rational` method to `MpmathPrinter` in `sympy/printing/mpmath.py`. I'll place it after the existing `_print_Float` method for consistency.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"/def _print_Float(self, e):/a \\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return \\\"mpf(%s)/%s\\\" % (e.p, e.q)\\n\" sympy/printing/mpmath.py\n```",

This is standard Python division, which uses floating-point arithmetic and loses precision.\n\nTo fix this, I need to modify how `lambdify` translates `Rational` numbers when the `mpmath` module is specified.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the code responsible for translating SymPy expressions for `lambdify` with `mpmath`.\n2.  Find how `Rational` numbers are currently handled.\n3.  Modify the handling of `Rational` numbers to produce `mpmath`-compatible code that preserves precision.\n4.  Verify the fix.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the translation code**\nThe PR description and my initial analysis suggest that `lambdify` uses a printer system. For `modules='mpmath'`, it seems to use a specific printer. A quick search in the codebase for `lambdify` and `mpmath` would point to `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py`. Inside this file, I can see that if `modules == 'mpmath'`, it uses `sympy.printing.mpmath.mpmath_printer`. This printer is an instance of `MpmathPrinter` from `sympy/printing/mpmath.py`.\n\n**Step 2: Current handling of `Rational`**\nThe `MpmathPrinter` inherits from `LambdaPrinter` (`sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py`). I'll check if `MpmathPrinter` has a method for printing rationals, e.g., `_print_Rational`. If not, it will use the one from `LambdaPrinter`.\nA check reveals `MpmathPrinter` does not have `_print_Rational`. `LambdaPrinter` has `_print_Rational`, which returns `'{}/{}'.format(expr.p, expr.q)`. This is the source of the problem, as it generates Python code for standard float division.\n\n**Step 3: Modify the handling of `Rational`**\nTo fix this, I need to add a `_print_Rational` method to `MpmathPrinter` in `sympy/printing/mpmath.py`. This new method should generate code that uses `mpmath`'s arbitrary-precision floating-point numbers.\nLooking at `_print_Float` in `MpmathPrinter`, it generates `mpf('%s')`. This is a good pattern. For a rational `p/q`, I can generate `mpf(p)/q`. `mpmath` will handle the division of an `mpf` object by an integer with full precision.\nSo, I will add the following method to `MpmathPrinter`:\n```python\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\n        return \"mpf(%s)/%s\" % (e.p, e.q)\n```\nThis will produce code like `mpf(232)/3`, which will be correctly evaluated by `mpmath`.\n\n**Step 4: Verification**\nI created a test script `reproduce_issue.py` to confirm the issue and will use it to verify the fix. After applying the change, I'll run the script again. The generated source code for the lambdified function should now contain `mpf(232)/3`, and the numerical result from `nsolve` should be more accurate, matching the expected high-precision value of 77 + 1/3.\n\nI will now apply the change using `sed`. I'll add the `_print_Rational` method to `MpmathPrinter` in `sympy/printing/mpmath.py`. I'll place it after the existing `_print_Float` method for consistency.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"/def _print_Float(self, e):/a \\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return \\\"mpf(%s)/%s\\\" % (e.p, e.q)\\n\" sympy/printing/mpmath.py\n```",

      "content": "THOUGHT:\nYes, this is it. `_print_Rational` in `StrPrinter` returns `\"%s/%s\" % (expr.p, expr.q)`. This is the source of the problem.\n\nTo fix this, I need to implement `_print_Rational` in `MpmathPrinter` to override this behavior.\nThe implementation should be `return \"mpf(%s)/%s\" % (e.p, e.q)`.\nHowever, `mpf` is not defined. The printer needs to be aware of the `mpmath` module.\nLooking at `_print_Float` in `MpmathPrinter`:\n`return '{func}({args})'.format(func=self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), args=args)`\nSo I should use `self._module_format('mpmath.mpf')`.\n\nMy proposed implementation for `_print_Rational` in `MpmathPrinter` is:\n```python\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\n        return \"{func}({p})/{q}\".format(\n            func=self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'),\n            p=e.p,\n            q=e.q\n        )\n```\nThis will generate `mpmath.mpf(232)/3`. This seems correct.\nI will add this method to `MpmathPrinter` in `sympy/printing/pycode.py`. I'll put it after `_print_Float`.\n\nThe `_print_Float` method is on line 325. I'll add my new method after it.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"333a \\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return '{func}({p})/{q}'.format(\\n            func=self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'),\\n            p=e.p,\\n            q=e.q\\n        )\\n\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis `sed` command is getting a bit complex. Let's try a simpler one.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"/def _print_Float(self, e):/a \\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return \\\"{func}({p})/{q}\\\".format(func=self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), p=e.p, q=e.q)\\n\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis is still a bit ugly with escaping. Let's try another approach. I'll use `ed` or just `cat` with a here-doc to create a patch file and apply it. `sed` is probably fine if I get the escaping right.\n\nLet's try to make it more readable.\nThe code to add is:\n```python\n\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\n        return \"mpf(%s)/%s\" % (e.p, e.q)\n```\nThis is simpler and should also work, assuming `mpf` is in scope of the generated function. `lambdify` does put `mpf` in scope.\nWait, `_print_Float` uses `self._module_format('mpmath.mpf')`. I should probably do the same for consistency.\n`return \"%s(%s)/%s\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)`\nThis will produce `mpmath.mpf(p)/q`. This is correct.\n\nLet's try the `sed` command again. I'll add it after the `_print_Float` method, which ends on line 332. The `a` command appends after the matched line. So I'll match line 332.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"332a \\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return '%s(%s)/%s' % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\\n\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis looks reasonable. Let's try it.\n\nWait, `_print_Float` ends on 332, but there is a blank line 333.

                "content": "THOUGHT:\nYes, this is it. `_print_Rational` in `StrPrinter` returns `\"%s/%s\" % (expr.p, expr.q)`. This is the source of the problem.\n\nTo fix this, I need to implement `_print_Rational` in `MpmathPrinter` to override this behavior.\nThe implementation should be `return \"mpf(%s)/%s\" % (e.p, e.q)`.\nHowever, `mpf` is not defined. The printer needs to be aware of the `mpmath` module.\nLooking at `_print_Float` in `MpmathPrinter`:\n`return '{func}({args})'.format(func=self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), args=args)`\nSo I should use `self._module_format('mpmath.mpf')`.\n\nMy proposed implementation for `_print_Rational` in `MpmathPrinter` is:\n```python\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\n        return \"{func}({p})/{q}\".format(\n            func=self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'),\n            p=e.p,\n            q=e.q\n        )\n```\nThis will generate `mpmath.mpf(232)/3`. This seems correct.\nI will add this method to `MpmathPrinter` in `sympy/printing/pycode.py`. I'll put it after `_print_Float`.\n\nThe `_print_Float` method is on line 325. I'll add my new method after it.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"333a \\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return '{func}({p})/{q}'.format(\\n            func=self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'),\\n            p=e.p,\\n            q=e.q\\n        )\\n\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis `sed` command is getting a bit complex. Let's try a simpler one.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"/def _print_Float(self, e):/a \\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return \\\"{func}({p})/{q}\\\".format(func=self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), p=e.p, q=e.q)\\n\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis is still a bit ugly with escaping. Let's try another approach. I'll use `ed` or just `cat` with a here-doc to create a patch file and apply it. `sed` is probably fine if I get the escaping right.\n\nLet's try to make it more readable.\nThe code to add is:\n```python\n\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\n        return \"mpf(%s)/%s\" % (e.p, e.q)\n```\nThis is simpler and should also work, assuming `mpf` is in scope of the generated function. `lambdify` does put `mpf` in scope.\nWait, `_print_Float` uses `self._module_format('mpmath.mpf')`. I should probably do the same for consistency.\n`return \"%s(%s)/%s\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)`\nThis will produce `mpmath.mpf(p)/q`. This is correct.\n\nLet's try the `sed` command again. I'll add it after the `_print_Float` method, which ends on line 332. The `a` command appends after the matched line. So I'll match line 332.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"332a \\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return '%s(%s)/%s' % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\\n\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis looks reasonable. Let's try it.\n\nWait, `_print_Float` ends on 332, but there is a blank line 333. I should append after 332.\nThe `_print_Float` method is:\n```python\n325     def _print_Float(self, e):\n326         # XXX: This does not handle setting mpmath.mp.dps. It is assumed that\n327         # the caller of the lambdified function will have set it to sufficient\n328         # precision to match the Floats in the expression.\n329 \n330         # Remove 'mpz' if gmpy is installed.\n331         args = str(tuple(map(int, e._mpf_)))\n332         return '{func}({args})'.format(func=self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), args=args)\n```\nAnd after it:\n```python\n334 \n335     def _print_uppergamma(self, e):\n```\nSo I should insert at line 334.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"334i \\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return '%s(%s)/%s' % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\\n\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis inserts before line 334. This should work.\n\nLet's check the original PR description again.\n`RisingFactorial(18, x) - 232/3`\nThe fix should make it `RisingFactorial(18, x) - mpf(232)/3`.\nThe `lambdify` function makes `mpf` available in the namespace.\nThe `_print_Float` uses `self._module_format('mpmath.mpf')`. This will either be `mpmath.mpf` or just `mpf` depending on settings. `lambdify` sets `fully_qualified_modules=False` by default for its printers.

I'll insert it after the `_print_Float` method. Based on my previous exploration, `_print_Float` ends at line 332, and the next method starts after a blank line at 334.

A common way to insert multiline text with `sed` is to use multiple `-e` expressions.\n\n```bash\nsed -i -e '333a\\' -e '\n' -e '    def _print_Rational(self, e):' -e '        return \"%s(%s)/%s\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)' sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's try another `sed` syntax that is more portable.\n```bash\nsed -i '333 a \\\n\\\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\\n        return \"%s(%s)/%s\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)\n' sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis is for BSD `sed`. I'm not sure which version is on the system.\n\nLet's try a simple, one-line insertion. It's less readable in the source, but less error-prone with `sed`.\n```python\ndef _print_Rational(self, e): return \"%s(%s)/%s\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\n```\nI will insert this as a single line.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"333a \\    def _print_Rational(self, e): return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis is still complex with quotes.\n\nLet's try to create a patch file.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > patch.txt\n333a\n\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\n        return \"%s(%s)/%s\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\nEOF\n```\nThen I need a tool to apply it. `ed` is not there. `patch` might be. But this is not a standard diff file.\n\nLet's go back to `sed`. The problem is that `\\n` is not being interpreted correctly.\nWhat if I insert the lines one by one?\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"333a     def _print_Rational(self, e):\" sympy/printing/pycode.py && \\\nsed -i \"334a         return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\" sympy/printing/pycode.py && \\\nsed -i \"333a \" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis should work. I'm appending the lines one by one. The line numbers will shift, so I need to be careful.\n1. `sed -i \"333a \" sympy/printing/pycode.py` -> adds blank line at 334\n2. `sed -i \"334a     def _print_Rational(self, e):\" sympy/printing/pycode.py` -> adds def at 335\n3. `sed -i \"335a         return ...\"` -> adds return at 336\n\nThis seems correct. Let's combine them.\n\n```bash\nsed -i -e '333a\\' -e '' -e '334a\\' -e '    def _print_Rational(self, e):' -e '335a\\' -e '        return \"%s(%s)/%s\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)' sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis is too complex.\n\nLet's try the here-doc approach again, but with a different tool. Maybe `perl` is available.\n```perl\nperl -i -p -e 'if ($. == 333) { print \"\\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)\\n\" }' sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis will print the new lines after line 333. The `-i` flag does in-place editing.\n\nLet's try a simpler `sed` command again. The GNU `sed` `a` command with `\\` should work.\n`sed -i '333a\\\\n...\\\\n...'`\nThe issue might be single vs double quotes.\nWith double quotes: `sed -i \"333a\\\\\\n...\"`\nThe shell will interpret `\\n`.\nWith single quotes: `sed -i '333a\\\\` and then a literal newline.\n\nLet's try this:\n```bash\nsed -i '333a\\\n\\\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\\n        return \"%s(%s)/%s\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)' sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis is a valid `sed` script. The backslashes escape the newlines. I need to escape the single quote for `mpmath.mpf`.\n\nLet's try to use `awk`.\n```bash\nawk '1; NR==333 {print \"\\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)\"}' sympy/printing/pycode.py > tmp && mv tmp sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis is safer. `1;` prints every line. At line 333, it prints the extra text.\n\nLet's try this `awk` command. It's robust.\n\n```bash\nawk '1; NR==333 {print \"\\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return \\\\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\\\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)\"}' sympy/printing/pycode.py > tmp.py && mv tmp.py sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nI need to escape the double quotes inside the `awk` print string.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. The simplest thing is to use `sed` and insert a one-liner. It's ugly but it will work.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"333a\\    def _print_Rational(self, e): return '%s(%s)/%s' % (self._module_format(\\\\'mpmath.mpf\\\\'), e.p, e.q)\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nI need to escape the single quotes. `\\'` becomes `'`. But inside double quotes, I don't need to escape single quotes.\n`sed -i \"333a\\    def _print_Rational(self, e): return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\" sympy/printing/pycode.py`\nThis looks better. The `a` command is followed by a backslash and then the text. This is for GNU `sed`.\n\nLet's try a different `sed` syntax which might be more portable.\n`sed -i '333i\\\\`\n`...`\n`' file`\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's go back to the `sed` command that failed and analyze it.\n`sed -i \"334i \\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return '%s(%s)/%s' % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\\n\" sympy/printing/pycode.py`\nThe `i` command inserts text. The text is the rest of the argument. The `\\n` is being interpreted by `sed`, not the shell. Some `sed` versions don't support `\\n` in the insert/append text. They require a literal newline.\n\nLet's try to provide a literal newline.\n```bash\nsed -i '333a \\\n    def _print_Rational(self, e): return \"%s(%s)/%s\" % (self._module_format(\\\"mpmath.mpf\\\"), e.p, e.q)\n' sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis is also complex with quoting.\n\nI will try the `awk` approach. It's the most explicit and least ambiguous.\n\n```bash\nawk 'NR==334{print \"\\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)\\n\"} 1' sympy/printing/pycode.py > tmp.py && mv tmp.py sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis prints the new text *before* line 334. And then `1` prints the current line. This is equivalent to `sed i`.\nI need to escape the quotes correctly. Inside `awk` single quotes, I can use double quotes freely. But for the python string, I need to escape them.\n`\"\\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\"\"`\nAnd the single quotes for `'mpmath.mpf'` are fine.\n\n```bash\nawk 'NR==334{print \"    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return \\\\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\\\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)\\n\"} 1' sympy/printing/pycode.py > tmp.py && mv tmp.py sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nI'll add a blank line before it too.\n`awk 'NR==334{print \"\\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return \\\\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\\\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)\\n\"} 1' sympy/printing/pycode.py > tmp.py && mv tmp.py sympy/printing/pycode.py`\n\nThis is still too complex. Let's try a very simple `sed` again.\nThe problem was `\\n` being interpreted as `n`. This is because of the `i` command syntax.\n`sed -i 'LINEi\\TEXT'`\nThe `\\n` is part of `TEXT`.\n\nLet's try `sed -i '334i TheText'` where TheText is on one line.\n`def _print_Rational(self, e): return ...`\nThis is a valid python one-liner.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"334i \\    def _print_Rational(self, e): return '%s(%s)/%s' % (self._module_format(\\\\'mpmath.mpf\\\\'), e.p, e.q)\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThe quoting is the hard part.\nInside double quotes, `\\'` is just `\\'`. I need `\\\\\\'`.\nNo, `self._module_format('mpmath.mpf')` is fine inside double quotes.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"334i \\    def _print_Rational(self, e): return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis looks correct. It inserts a single line of code before line 334. It's not perfectly indented, but it should be syntactically correct. The original `_print_Float` is also not perfectly PEP8.\n\nLet's try this. It's a single command and it's understandable.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"334i\\    def _print_Rational(self, e): return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nI'll also add a blank line for readability.\n```bash\nsed -i \"334i\\ \" sympy/printing/pycode.py && sed -i \"335i\\    def _print_Rational(self, e): return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis is two commands. I can only run one.\n\nLet's use the `sed` syntax with escaped newlines, which is supposed to be portable.\n```bash\nsed -i '333a\\\n\\\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\\n        return \"%s(%s)/%s\" % (self._module_format(\"mpmath.mpf\"), e.p, e.q)\n' sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nI've changed all quotes to be double quotes to avoid escaping issues. This should work.\n\nLet's try it.",

It's less readable in the source, but less error-prone with `sed`.\n```python\ndef _print_Rational(self, e): return \"%s(%s)/%s\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\n```\nI will insert this as a single line.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"333a \\    def _print_Rational(self, e): return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis is still complex with quotes.\n\nLet's try to create a patch file.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > patch.txt\n333a\n\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\n        return \"%s(%s)/%s\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\nEOF\n```\nThen I need a tool to apply it. `ed` is not there. `patch` might be. But this is not a standard diff file.\n\nLet's go back to `sed`. The problem is that `\\n` is not being interpreted correctly.\nWhat if I insert the lines one by one?\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"333a     def _print_Rational(self, e):\" sympy/printing/pycode.py && \\\nsed -i \"334a         return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\" sympy/printing/pycode.py && \\\nsed -i \"333a \" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis should work. I'm appending the lines one by one. The line numbers will shift, so I need to be careful.\n1. `sed -i \"333a \" sympy/printing/pycode.py` -> adds blank line at 334\n2. `sed -i \"334a     def _print_Rational(self, e):\" sympy/printing/pycode.py` -> adds def at 335\n3. `sed -i \"335a         return ...\"` -> adds return at 336\n\nThis seems correct. Let's combine them.\n\n```bash\nsed -i -e '333a\\' -e '' -e '334a\\' -e '    def _print_Rational(self, e):' -e '335a\\' -e '        return \"%s(%s)/%s\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)' sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis is too complex.\n\nLet's try the here-doc approach again, but with a different tool. Maybe `perl` is available.\n```perl\nperl -i -p -e 'if ($. == 333) { print \"\\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)\\n\" }' sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis will print the new lines after line 333. The `-i` flag does in-place editing.\n\nLet's try a simpler `sed` command again. The GNU `sed` `a` command with `\\` should work.\n`sed -i '333a\\\\n...\\\\n...'`\nThe issue might be single vs double quotes.\nWith double quotes: `sed -i \"333a\\\\\\n...\"`\nThe shell will interpret `\\n`.\nWith single quotes: `sed -i '333a\\\\` and then a literal newline.\n\nLet's try this:\n```bash\nsed -i '333a\\\n\\\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\\n        return \"%s(%s)/%s\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)' sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis is a valid `sed` script. The backslashes escape the newlines. I need to escape the single quote for `mpmath.mpf`.\n\nLet's try to use `awk`.\n```bash\nawk '1; NR==333 {print \"\\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)\"}' sympy/printing/pycode.py > tmp && mv tmp sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis is safer. `1;` prints every line. At line 333, it prints the extra text.\n\nLet's try this `awk` command. It's robust.\n\n```bash\nawk '1; NR==333 {print \"\\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return \\\\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\\\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)\"}' sympy/printing/pycode.py > tmp.py && mv tmp.py sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nI need to escape the double quotes inside the `awk` print string.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. The simplest thing is to use `sed` and insert a one-liner. It's ugly but it will work.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"333a\\    def _print_Rational(self, e): return '%s(%s)/%s' % (self._module_format(\\\\'mpmath.mpf\\\\'), e.p, e.q)\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nI need to escape the single quotes. `\\'` becomes `'`. But inside double quotes, I don't need to escape single quotes.\n`sed -i \"333a\\    def _print_Rational(self, e): return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\" sympy/printing/pycode.py`\nThis looks better. The `a` command is followed by a backslash and then the text. This is for GNU `sed`.\n\nLet's try a different `sed` syntax which might be more portable.\n`sed -i '333i\\\\`\n`...`\n`' file`\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's go back to the `sed` command that failed and analyze it.\n`sed -i \"334i \\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return '%s(%s)/%s' % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\\n\" sympy/printing/pycode.py`\nThe `i` command inserts text. The text is the rest of the argument. The `\\n` is being interpreted by `sed`, not the shell. Some `sed` versions don't support `\\n` in the insert/append text. They require a literal newline.\n\nLet's try to provide a literal newline.\n```bash\nsed -i '333a \\\n    def _print_Rational(self, e): return \"%s(%s)/%s\" % (self._module_format(\\\"mpmath.mpf\\\"), e.p, e.q)\n' sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis is also complex with quoting.\n\nI will try the `awk` approach. It's the most explicit and least ambiguous.\n\n```bash\nawk 'NR==334{print \"\\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)\\n\"} 1' sympy/printing/pycode.py > tmp.py && mv tmp.py sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis prints the new text *before* line 334. And then `1` prints the current line. This is equivalent to `sed i`.\nI need to escape the quotes correctly. Inside `awk` single quotes, I can use double quotes freely. But for the python string, I need to escape them.\n`\"\\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\"\"`\nAnd the single quotes for `'mpmath.mpf'` are fine.\n\n```bash\nawk 'NR==334{print \"    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return \\\\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\\\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)\\n\"} 1' sympy/printing/pycode.py > tmp.py && mv tmp.py sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nI'll add a blank line before it too.\n`awk 'NR==334{print \"\\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\n        return \\\\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\\\" % (self._module_format(\\'mpmath.mpf\\'), e.p, e.q)\\n\"} 1' sympy/printing/pycode.py > tmp.py && mv tmp.py sympy/printing/pycode.py`\n\nThis is still too complex. Let's try a very simple `sed` again.\nThe problem was `\\n` being interpreted as `n`. This is because of the `i` command syntax.\n`sed -i 'LINEi\\TEXT'`\nThe `\\n` is part of `TEXT`.\n\nLet's try `sed -i '334i TheText'` where TheText is on one line.\n`def _print_Rational(self, e): return ...`\nThis is a valid python one-liner.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"334i \\    def _print_Rational(self, e): return '%s(%s)/%s' % (self._module_format(\\\\'mpmath.mpf\\\\'), e.p, e.q)\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThe quoting is the hard part.\nInside double quotes, `\\'` is just `\\'`. I need `\\\\\\'`.\nNo, `self._module_format('mpmath.mpf')` is fine inside double quotes.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"334i \\    def _print_Rational(self, e): return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis looks correct. It inserts a single line of code before line 334. It's not perfectly indented, but it should be syntactically correct. The original `_print_Float` is also not perfectly PEP8.\n\nLet's try this. It's a single command and it's understandable.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"334i\\    def _print_Rational(self, e): return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nI'll also add a blank line for readability.\n```bash\nsed -i \"334i\\ \" sympy/printing/pycode.py && sed -i \"335i\\    def _print_Rational(self, e): return \\\"%s(%s)/%s\\\" % (self._module_format('mpmath.mpf'), e.p, e.q)\" sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nThis is two commands. I can only run one.\n\nLet's use the `sed` syntax with escaped newlines, which is supposed to be portable.\n```bash\nsed -i '333a\\\n\\\n    def _print_Rational(self, e):\\\n        return \"%s(%s)/%s\" % (self._module_format(\"mpmath.mpf\"), e.p, e.q)\n' sympy/printing/pycode.py\n```\nI've changed all quotes to be double quotes to avoid escaping issues. This should work.\n\nLet's try it.",
