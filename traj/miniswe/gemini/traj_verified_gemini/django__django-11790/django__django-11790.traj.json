Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.py\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.py | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.py\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.py\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.py | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.py | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

The problem is that the `maxlength` attribute is missing.

This is the file I need to examine.\n\nThe PR description mentions that the regression was introduced in `#27515` and commit `5ceaf14686ce626404afb6a5fbd3d8286410bf13`. This is a good clue. The problem is that the `maxlength` attribute is missing. This usually comes from the model field's `max_length` attribute.\n\nLet's examine the `AuthenticationForm` in `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`. I want to see how the `username` field is defined. It's likely that it's not correctly picking up the `max_length` from the `User` model's `username` field.\n\nI will now display the contents of `django/contrib/auth/forms.py` around the `AuthenticationForm` definition.```bash\nnl -ba django/contrib/auth/forms.py | sed -n '1,100p'\n```",

      "content": "THOUGHT: Okay, I've found `AuthenticationForm` starting at line 163.\n\nHere's the relevant part:\n\n```python\n163: class AuthenticationForm(forms.Form):\n164:     \"\"\"\n165:     Base class for authenticating users. Extend this to get a form that accepts\n166:     username/password logins.\n167:     \"\"\"\n168:     username = UsernameField(widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={'autofocus': True}))\n169:     password = forms.CharField(\n170:         label=_(\"Password\"),\n171:         strip=False,\n172:         widget=forms.PasswordInput(attrs={'autocomplete': 'current-password'}),\n173:     )\n...\n183:     def __init__(self, request=None, *args, **kwargs):\n...\n192:         # Set the max length and label for the \"username\" field.\n193:         self.username_field = UserModel._meta.get_field(UserModel.USERNAME_FIELD)\n194:         self.fields['username'].max_length = self.username_field.max_length or 254\n195:         if self.fields['username'].label is None:\n196:             self.fields['username'].label = capfirst(self.username_field.verbose_name)\n```\n\nThe `username` field is defined at line 168 as an instance of `UsernameField`.\n`UsernameField` is defined earlier (lines 60-69) and inherits from `forms.CharField`.\n\nIn the `__init__` method (lines 183-197), there's code to set the `max_length` of the username field:\n`self.fields['username'].max_length = self.username_field.max_length or 254`\n\nThis sets the `max_length` on the *form field*, which is used for validation. However, it does *not* set the `maxlength` attribute on the *widget*, which is what becomes the HTML attribute.\n\nThe regression was likely introduced when `UsernameField` was created. Before that, the `username` field was probably a standard `CharField` and its `max_length` was set at declaration time, which would have propagated to the widget.\n\nWith `username = UsernameField(...)`, the `max_length` isn't passed to the constructor. It's set later in `__init__`. The widget is created when the field is instantiated, and at that point, `max_length` is not known.\n\nThe fix is to also update the widget's `maxlength` attribute.\n\nI can add this line in the `__init__` method:\n`self.fields['username'].widget.attrs['maxlength'] = self.fields['username'].max_length`\n\nLet's look at `UsernameField` again.\n```python\n60: class UsernameField(forms.CharField):\n61:     def to_python(self, value):\n62:         return unicodedata.normalize('NFKC', super().to_python(value))\n63: \n64:     def widget_attrs(self, widget):\n65:         return {\n66:             **super().widget_attrs(widget),\n67:             'autocapitalize': 'none',\n68:             'autocomplete': 'username',\n69:         }\n```\n`UsernameField` has a `widget_attrs` method. This method is called by the widget to get extra attributes. However, `widget_attrs` on the field doesn't seem to have access to the field's `max_length` when it's called.\n\nThe problem is that `max_length` is set on the field instance *after* the widget has been instantiated. When a form field is created, if `max_length` is provided, it's passed to the widget.\n\nExample: `forms.CharField(max_length=10)` will result in `<input type=\"text\" maxlength=\"10\">`. This is because `Field.__init__` does something like:\n```python\n# django/forms/fields.py\nclass Field:\n    def __init__(self, ..., max_length=None, ...):\n        ...\n        self.max_length = max_length\n        ...\n        extra_attrs = self.widget_attrs(widget)\n        if extra_attrs:\n            widget.attrs.update(extra_attrs)\n```\nAnd `CharField.widget_attrs` does this:\n```python\n# django/forms/fields.py\nclass CharField(Field):\n    def widget_attrs(self, widget):\n        attrs = super().widget_attrs(widget)\n        if self.max_length is not None and isinstance(widget, (TextInput, Textarea)):\n            attrs['maxlength'] = str(self.max_length)\n        return attrs\n```\nSo `CharField`'s `widget_attrs` is responsible for adding `maxlength`. `UsernameField` inherits from `CharField`, but it overrides `widget_attrs` and doesn't call `super()` correctly to get the `maxlength` attribute. No, wait, it does call `super()`: `**super().widget_attrs(widget)`.\n\nThe issue is that when `UsernameField` is instantiated on line 168, `max_length` is not passed. So `self.max_length` is `None`.\nLater, in `AuthenticationForm.__init__`, `self.fields['username'].max_length` is set. But this is too late for the widget attributes to be updated automatically.\n\nThe fix is to manually update the widget's attributes.\n\nSo, after line 194, I should add:\n`self.fields['username'].widget.attrs['maxlength'] = self.fields['username'].max_length`\n\nLet's check if `self.fields['username'].max_length` is an integer. Yes, `self.username_field.max_length` is an integer from the model field, or 254. The widget attribute `maxlength` should be a string, but Django handles the conversion.\n\nSo the change is in `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`. I will add the line.\n\nThe line to add is `self.fields['username'].widget.attrs['maxlength'] = self.fields['username'].max_length` after line 194.\n\n```python\n192\t        # Set the max length and label for the \"username\" field.\n193\t        self.username_field = UserModel._meta.get_field(UserModel.USERNAME_FIELD)\n194\t        self.fields['username'].max_length = self.username_field.max_length or 254\n195\t        if self.fields['username'].label is None:\n196\t            self.fields['username'].label = capfirst(self.username_field.verbose_name)\n```\nI will add the line after 194.\n\n```python\n192\t        # Set the max length and label for the \"username\" field.\n193\t        self.username_field = UserModel._meta.get_field(UserModel.USERNAME_FIELD)\n194\t        self.fields['username'].max_length = self.username_field.max_length or 254\n194a       self.fields['username'].widget.attrs['maxlength'] = self.fields['username'].max_length\n195\t        if self.fields['username'].label is None:\n196\t            self.fields['username'].label = capfirst(self.username_field.verbose_name)\n```\n\nThis seems correct. It directly addresses the problem of the widget attribute not being set.\n\nLet's apply this with `sed`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"194a\\        self.fields['username'].widget.attrs['maxlength'] = self.fields['username'].max_length\" django/contrib/auth/forms.py\n```\n\nLet's verify the change.\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/django/contrib/auth/forms.py\nLines: 190-200\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba django/contrib/auth/forms.py | sed -n '190,200p'\n```\n\nWait, I should apply the change first.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"194a\\        if UserModel.USERNAME_FIELD in self.fields:\\n            self.fields[UserModel.USERNAME_FIELD].widget.attrs.update({'maxlength': self.username_field.max_length})\" django/contrib/auth/forms.py\n```\nNo, that's too complex. The simple line is better.\n\nLet's re-read the code.\nThe `username` field is always present.\n`self.fields['username']` is safe.\n`self.fields['username'].max_length` is set on line 194.\nSo I can use it on the next line.\n\nThe PR description mentions commit `5ceaf14686ce626404afb6a5fbd3d8286410bf13`. I should check what it did. I can't do that in this environment. But the logic seems sound.\n\nThe problem is that `max_length` is set on the field, but not propagated to the widget.\nThe fix is to propagate it.\n\nLet's look at `UserCreationForm` (lines 93-96).\n```python\n93\t    class Meta:\n94\t        model = User\n95\t        fields = (\"username\",)\n96\t        field_classes = {'username': UsernameField}\n```\nThis is a `ModelForm`. `ModelForm`s handle `max_length` correctly. `AuthenticationForm` is a `forms.Form`, not a `ModelForm`, so it needs manual handling. This confirms my suspicion.\n\nIn `UserCreationForm`, `formfield_for_dbfield` will be called, which will get `max_length` from the model field and pass it to the form field constructor. `AuthenticationForm` doesn't do that, it constructs the field manually and then adjusts properties.\n\nSo, the proposed change is correct.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"194a\\        self.fields['username'].widget.attrs['maxlength'] = self.fields['username'].max_length\" django/contrib/auth/forms.py\n```\n\nThis seems right. Let's do it.\n\nI will also check the surrounding code to make sure my `sed` command is correct.\nLine 194 is `self.fields['username'].max_length = self.username_field.max_length or 254`.\nLine 195 is `if self.fields['username'].label is None:`.\nMy `sed` command with `194a` will append a new line after line 194. This is what I want.\n\nThe indentation needs to be correct. 8 spaces.\n`\"194a\\        self.fields['username'].widget.attrs['maxlength'] = self.fields['username'].max_length\"`\nThe indentation is 8 spaces. This looks correct.\n\nLet's execute the command.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"194a\\        self.fields['username'].widget.attrs['maxlength'] = self.fields['username'].max_length\" django/contrib/auth/forms.py\n```\n\nNow I will verify the change.\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/django/contrib/auth/forms.py\nLines: 190-200\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba django/contrib/auth/forms.py | sed -n '190,200p'\n```\nWait, I should combine them.

                "content": "THOUGHT: Okay, I've found `AuthenticationForm` starting at line 163.\n\nHere's the relevant part:\n\n```python\n163: class AuthenticationForm(forms.Form):\n164:     \"\"\"\n165:     Base class for authenticating users. Extend this to get a form that accepts\n166:     username/password logins.\n167:     \"\"\"\n168:     username = UsernameField(widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={'autofocus': True}))\n169:     password = forms.CharField(\n170:         label=_(\"Password\"),\n171:         strip=False,\n172:         widget=forms.PasswordInput(attrs={'autocomplete': 'current-password'}),\n173:     )\n...\n183:     def __init__(self, request=None, *args, **kwargs):\n...\n192:         # Set the max length and label for the \"username\" field.\n193:         self.username_field = UserModel._meta.get_field(UserModel.USERNAME_FIELD)\n194:         self.fields['username'].max_length = self.username_field.max_length or 254\n195:         if self.fields['username'].label is None:\n196:             self.fields['username'].label = capfirst(self.username_field.verbose_name)\n```\n\nThe `username` field is defined at line 168 as an instance of `UsernameField`.\n`UsernameField` is defined earlier (lines 60-69) and inherits from `forms.CharField`.\n\nIn the `__init__` method (lines 183-197), there's code to set the `max_length` of the username field:\n`self.fields['username'].max_length = self.username_field.max_length or 254`\n\nThis sets the `max_length` on the *form field*, which is used for validation. However, it does *not* set the `maxlength` attribute on the *widget*, which is what becomes the HTML attribute.\n\nThe regression was likely introduced when `UsernameField` was created. Before that, the `username` field was probably a standard `CharField` and its `max_length` was set at declaration time, which would have propagated to the widget.\n\nWith `username = UsernameField(...)`, the `max_length` isn't passed to the constructor. It's set later in `__init__`. The widget is created when the field is instantiated, and at that point, `max_length` is not known.\n\nThe fix is to also update the widget's `maxlength` attribute.\n\nI can add this line in the `__init__` method:\n`self.fields['username'].widget.attrs['maxlength'] = self.fields['username'].max_length`\n\nLet's look at `UsernameField` again.\n```python\n60: class UsernameField(forms.CharField):\n61:     def to_python(self, value):\n62:         return unicodedata.normalize('NFKC', super().to_python(value))\n63: \n64:     def widget_attrs(self, widget):\n65:         return {\n66:             **super().widget_attrs(widget),\n67:             'autocapitalize': 'none',\n68:             'autocomplete': 'username',\n69:         }\n```\n`UsernameField` has a `widget_attrs` method. This method is called by the widget to get extra attributes. However, `widget_attrs` on the field doesn't seem to have access to the field's `max_length` when it's called.\n\nThe problem is that `max_length` is set on the field instance *after* the widget has been instantiated. When a form field is created, if `max_length` is provided, it's passed to the widget.\n\nExample: `forms.CharField(max_length=10)` will result in `<input type=\"text\" maxlength=\"10\">`. This is because `Field.__init__` does something like:\n```python\n# django/forms/fields.py\nclass Field:\n    def __init__(self, ..., max_length=None, ...):\n        ...\n        self.max_length = max_length\n        ...\n        extra_attrs = self.widget_attrs(widget)\n        if extra_attrs:\n            widget.attrs.update(extra_attrs)\n```\nAnd `CharField.widget_attrs` does this:\n```python\n# django/forms/fields.py\nclass CharField(Field):\n    def widget_attrs(self, widget):\n        attrs = super().widget_attrs(widget)\n        if self.max_length is not None and isinstance(widget, (TextInput, Textarea)):\n            attrs['maxlength'] = str(self.max_length)\n        return attrs\n```\nSo `CharField`'s `widget_attrs` is responsible for adding `maxlength`. `UsernameField` inherits from `CharField`, but it overrides `widget_attrs` and doesn't call `super()` correctly to get the `maxlength` attribute.
