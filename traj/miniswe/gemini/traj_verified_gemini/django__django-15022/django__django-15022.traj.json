      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "THOUGHT:\nThe user wants to fix a performance issue in the Django admin's search functionality.\nThe problem description states that when searching with multiple words on fields that span relationships, Django generates a separate `JOIN` for each search term. This is caused by a `queryset.filter()` call inside a loop that iterates over the words in the search term.\n\nMy plan is to modify the search logic to avoid this. Instead of filtering the queryset iteratively for each search word, I will collect all the filter conditions (`Q` objects) and then apply them all at once in a single `queryset.filter()` call. This will allow Django's ORM to optimize the query and reuse `JOIN`s.\n\nThe relevant code is in the `get_search_results` method of `ModelAdmin`, which is located in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`.\n\nI will perform the following steps:\n1.  Locate the `get_search_results` method in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`.\n2.  Identify the loop that iterates over search terms and applies filters.\n3.  Modify the code to:\n    a. Initialize an empty list (e.g., `and_queries`) before the loop.\n    b. Inside the loop, instead of filtering the queryset, create a `Q` object for the current search word and append it to the `and_queries` list.\n    c. After the loop, combine all `Q` objects in the `and_queries` list using `operator.and_` and apply them in a single `queryset.filter()` call. I must also add a check to only filter if the `and_queries` list is not empty.\n4.  I will use a scriptable editor like `ed` to perform this multi-line code replacement to ensure atomicity and correctness.\n\nBased on my exploration of the file, the code to be changed is around lines 1021-1024. The logic I'll use is to delete the old loop body and insert the new logic.\n\nThe original code snippet to be replaced is:\n```python\n            for bit in search_term.split():\n                or_queries = [models.Q(**{orm_lookup: bit})\n                              for orm_lookup in orm_lookups]\n                queryset = queryset.filter(reduce(operator.or_, or_queries))\n```\n\nI will replace it with:\n```python\n            and_queries = []\n            for bit in search_term.split():\n                or_queries = [models.Q(**{orm_lookup: bit})\n                              for orm_lookup in orm_lookups]\n                and_queries.append(reduce(operator.or_, or_queries))\n            if and_queries:\n                queryset = queryset.filter(reduce(operator.and_, and_queries))\n```\nThis change aggregates the conditions and applies them once, which should resolve the multiple `JOIN`s issue. I will use `ed` to replace lines 1021-1024 with this new block of code, appending it after line 1020.\n\n```bash\ned -s django/contrib/admin/options.py <<'EOF'\n1021,1024d\n1020a\n            and_queries = []\n            for bit in search_term.split():\n                or_queries = [models.Q(**{orm_lookup: bit})\n                              for orm_lookup in orm_lookups]\n                and_queries.append(reduce(operator.or_, or_queries))\n            if and_queries:\n                queryset = queryset.filter(reduce(operator.and_, and_queries))\n.\nw\nq\nEOF\n```",

                "content": "THOUGHT:\nThe user wants to fix a performance issue in the Django admin's search functionality.\nThe problem description states that when searching with multiple words on fields that span relationships, Django generates a separate `JOIN` for each search term. This is caused by a `queryset.filter()` call inside a loop that iterates over the words in the search term.\n\nMy plan is to modify the search logic to avoid this. Instead of filtering the queryset iteratively for each search word, I will collect all the filter conditions (`Q` objects) and then apply them all at once in a single `queryset.filter()` call. This will allow Django's ORM to optimize the query and reuse `JOIN`s.\n\nThe relevant code is in the `get_search_results` method of `ModelAdmin`, which is located in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`.\n\nI will perform the following steps:\n1.  Locate the `get_search_results` method in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`.\n2.  Identify the loop that iterates over search terms and applies filters.\n3.  Modify the code to:\n    a. Initialize an empty list (e.g., `and_queries`) before the loop.\n    b. Inside the loop, instead of filtering the queryset, create a `Q` object for the current search word and append it to the `and_queries` list.\n    c. After the loop, combine all `Q` objects in the `and_queries` list using `operator.and_` and apply them in a single `queryset.filter()` call. I must also add a check to only filter if the `and_queries` list is not empty.\n4.  I will use a scriptable editor like `ed` to perform this multi-line code replacement to ensure atomicity and correctness.\n\nBased on my exploration of the file, the code to be changed is around lines 1021-1024. The logic I'll use is to delete the old loop body and insert the new logic.\n\nThe original code snippet to be replaced is:\n```python\n            for bit in search_term.split():\n                or_queries = [models.Q(**{orm_lookup: bit})\n                              for orm_lookup in orm_lookups]\n                queryset = queryset.filter(reduce(operator.or_, or_queries))\n```\n\nI will replace it with:\n```python\n            and_queries = []\n            for bit in search_term.split():\n                or_queries = [models.Q(**{orm_lookup: bit})\n                              for orm_lookup in orm_lookups]\n                and_queries.append(reduce(operator.or_, or_queries))\n            if and_queries:\n                queryset = queryset.filter(reduce(operator.and_, and_queries))\n```\nThis change aggregates the conditions and applies them once, which should resolve the multiple `JOIN`s issue. I will use `ed` to replace lines 1021-1024 with this new block of code, appending it after line 1020.\n\n```bash\ned -s django/contrib/admin/options.py <<'EOF'\n1021,1024d\n1020a\n            and_queries = []\n            for bit in search_term.split():\n                or_queries = [models.Q(**{orm_lookup: bit})\n                              for orm_lookup in orm_lookups]\n                and_queries.append(reduce(operator.or_, or_queries))\n            if and_queries:\n                queryset = queryset.filter(reduce(operator.and_, and_queries))\n.\nw\nq\nEOF\n```",

      "content": "THOUGHT:\nI've examined the code and the logic is indeed different from what was described in the PR for Django 1.2.5. The current version of the code (likely a newer Django) already seems to be doing something similar to what the patch intended, but not quite.\n\nThe relevant part is:\n```python\n  1034\t            for bit in smart_split(search_term):\n  1035\t                if bit.startswith(('\"', \"'\")) and bit[0] == bit[-1]:\n  1036\t                    bit = unescape_string_literal(bit)\n  1037\t                or_queries = models.Q(\n  1038\t                    *((orm_lookup, bit) for orm_lookup in orm_lookups),\n  1039\t                    _connector=models.Q.OR,\n  1040\t                )\n  1041\t                queryset = queryset.filter(or_queries)\n```\nThis code iterates over each word (`bit`) from the `search_term` and applies a `queryset.filter()` for each word. This is exactly the problem described in the PR. For each word, it creates a `Q` object that `OR`s together lookups for all `search_fields`, and then `AND`s this with the previous filters by calling `queryset.filter()`.\n\nThe fix is the same as I originally planned: collect all the conditions and apply them in a single `filter()` call.\n\nThe original plan was to replace:\n```python\n            for bit in search_term.split():\n                or_queries = [models.Q(**{orm_lookup: bit})\n                              for orm_lookup in orm_lookups]\n                queryset = queryset.filter(reduce(operator.or_, or_queries))\n```\nwith\n```python\n            and_queries = []\n            for bit in search_term.split():\n                or_queries = [models.Q(**{orm_lookup: bit})\n                              for orm_lookup in orm_lookups]\n                and_queries.append(reduce(operator.or_, or_queries))\n            if and_queries:\n                queryset = queryset.filter(reduce(operator.and_, and_queries))\n```\nThe current code is slightly different. It uses `smart_split` and a generator expression inside `models.Q`. I need to adapt my fix to this new structure.\n\nThe new code should look like this:\n```python\n            and_queries = []\n            for bit in smart_split(search_term):\n                if bit.startswith(('\"', \"'\")) and bit[0] == bit[-1]:\n                    bit = unescape_string_literal(bit)\n                or_queries = models.Q(\n                    *((orm_lookup, bit) for orm_lookup in orm_lookups),\n                    _connector=models.Q.OR\n                )\n                and_queries.append(or_queries)\n            if and_queries:\n                queryset = queryset.filter(*and_queries)\n```\nUsing `queryset.filter(*and_queries)` is equivalent to `queryset.filter(and_queries[0], and_queries[1], ...)` which `AND`s the conditions together. This is cleaner than using `reduce(operator.and_, and_queries)`. I'll also need to import `unescape_string_literal` and `smart_split` if they are not already in scope. Looking at the file, `smart_split` is imported from `django.utils.text` and `unescape_string_literal` from `django.db.models.sql.query`. I need to check if they are available in `options.py`.\n\nI'll check the imports at the top of the file.\n```bash\nhead -n 40 django/contrib/admin/options.py\n```",

Let's see if it's imported.\n\nI'll search for `smart_split` and `unescape_string_literal` imports in the whole `django` directory to be sure.\n```bash\ngrep -r \"from .* import .*smart_split\" django/\n```\n```bash\ngrep -r \"from .* import .*unescape_string_literal\" django/\n```\n\nActually, I don't need to worry about the imports. They must be available in the scope of `get_search_results` if the code is already using them. The `sed` output from line 1034 shows `smart_split(search_term)`. It must be imported. Let me re-check the imports.\n\nAh, I see `from django.contrib.admin.utils import ...` but not `smart_split`.\nAnd `from django.db import models` but not `unescape_string_literal` from a sub-module.\n\nLet's look at `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` to see if `smart_split` is there.\nAnd `django/db/models/sql/query.py` for `unescape_string_literal`.\n\n```bash\ngrep \"smart_split\" django/contrib/admin/utils.py\n```\n```bash\ngrep \"unescape_string_literal\" django/db/models/sql/query.py\n```\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's re-examine `django/contrib/admin/options.py`. Maybe they are imported with a different name or from a different place.\n\n```bash\ngrep -n \"smart_split\" django/contrib/admin/options.py\n```\nThis returned nothing before.

The issue is that `queryset.filter()` is called inside a loop over search terms, leading to excessive `JOIN`s in the resulting SQL query.\n\nThe fix is to collect the filter conditions (`Q` objects) for each search term in a list and then apply them all at once in a single `queryset.filter()` call outside the loop. This allows the ORM to combine the conditions with `AND` and optimize the query, reusing `JOIN`s where possible.\n\nThe code to be replaced is within the `get_search_results` method, from lines 1034 to 1041. I will replace the loop body that filters the queryset on each iteration with logic that appends `Q` objects to a list. After the loop, I will filter the queryset using the collected `Q` objects.\n\nI will use a combination of `head`, `cat` (with a here-document), and `tail` to construct a new version of the file with the changes. This new file will be written to a temporary location, and then I will use `mv` to replace the original file. This approach is robust and avoids complex `sed` syntax.\n\nThe new code block will be:\n```python\n            and_queries = []\n            for bit in smart_split(search_term):\n                if bit.startswith(('\"', \"'\")) and bit[0] == bit[-1]:\n                    bit = unescape_string_literal(bit)\n                or_queries = models.Q(\n                    *((orm_lookup, bit) for orm_lookup in orm_lookups),\n                    _connector=models.Q.OR,\n                )\n                and_queries.append(or_queries)\n            if and_queries:\n                queryset = queryset.filter(*and_queries)\n```\nThis code replaces the iterative filtering with a single filtering call, which should resolve the performance problem.
