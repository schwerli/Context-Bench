Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.py\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.py | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.py\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.py\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.py | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.py | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

      "content": "THOUGHT:\nThe relevant code is at line 95:\n`self.real_apps = real_apps if isinstance(real_apps, set) else set(real_apps)`\n\nThe PR description says to replace this with an assertion that `real_apps` is a set when it's not `None`.\n\nSo, I need to change this:\n```python\n        if real_apps:\n            self.real_apps = real_apps if isinstance(real_apps, set) else set(real_apps)\n        else:\n            self.real_apps = set()\n```\n\nto something like this:\n```python\n        if real_apps is not None:\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\n            self.real_apps = real_apps\n        else:\n            self.real_apps = set()\n```\n\nThis can be simplified. The `else` part handles `real_apps` being `None` or an empty container. The original code handles `real_apps` being `None` by going to the `else` block. If `real_apps` is an empty list, it becomes an empty set. If it's `None`, it becomes an empty set.\n\nThe new logic should be:\nIf `real_apps` is not `None`, assert it's a set.\nThen assign `real_apps` to `self.real_apps` if it's not `None`, otherwise assign an empty set.\n\nThis can be written as:\n```python\n        if real_apps is not None:\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\n            self.real_apps = real_apps\n        else:\n            self.real_apps = set()\n```\n\nLet's look at the original code again.\n`if real_apps:`\nThis is true for non-empty lists/sets. If `real_apps` is `None`, it's false.\nIf `real_apps` is `None`, `self.real_apps` becomes `set()`.\nIf `real_apps` is `[]`, `self.real_apps` becomes `set()`.\nIf `real_apps` is `set()`, `self.real_apps` becomes `set()`.\n\nThe logic `real_apps if isinstance(real_apps, set) else set(real_apps)` handles both list and set. The PR says it's always a set now.\n\nSo I can change:\n```python\n        if real_apps:\n            self.real_apps = real_apps if isinstance(real_apps, set) else set(real_apps)\n        else:\n            self.real_apps = set()\n```\nto:\n```python\n        if real_apps is not None:\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()\n```\nThis seems correct. If `real_apps` is `None`, `self.real_apps` becomes `set()`. If `real_apps` is a set (even an empty one), it is assigned to `self.real_apps`. The assertion will check if it's a set when not `None`.\n\nLet's check the logic of `real_apps or set()`.\nIf `real_apps` is `None`, this evaluates to `set()`.\nIf `real_apps` is `{'a', 'b'}`, this evaluates to `{'a', 'b'}`.\nIf `real_apps` is `set()`, this evaluates to `set()`.\nThis seems to cover all cases correctly.\n\nSo the lines to change are 94-97.\n```python\n        # Apps to include from main registry, usually unmigrated ones\n        if real_apps:\n            self.real_apps = real_apps if isinstance(real_apps, set) else set(real_apps)\n        else:\n            self.real_apps = set()\n```\nI will replace these with:\n```python\n        # Apps to include from main registry, usually unmigrated ones.\n        if real_apps is not None:\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()\n```\nThis looks good. I will use `sed` to perform the replacement.\n\nThe original lines are:\n```python\n        if real_apps:\n            self.real_apps = real_apps if isinstance(real_apps, set) else set(real_apps)\n        else:\n            self.real_apps = set()\n```\nThis is spread across multiple lines. I'll need a more powerful `sed` command.\n\nI can replace line 95, and delete 94, 96, 97.\nOr I can try to replace a block.\n\nLet's try to replace line 95 first.\n`sed -i \"95s/.*/            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)/\" django/db/migrations/state.py`\nThis would change line 95. But I need to change more.\n\nLet's try to do this with a single `sed` command with multiple expressions.\nI want to change lines 94-97.\n\nOriginal:\n```\n    94\t        if real_apps:\n    95\t            self.real_apps = real_apps if isinstance(real_apps, set) else set(real_apps)\n    96\t        else:\n    97\t            self.real_apps = set()\n```\n\nNew:\n```\n            if real_apps is not None:\n                assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\n            self.real_apps = real_apps or set()\n```\nThe indentation is important. 12 spaces.\n\nLet's try to construct the `sed` command.\nI can use `c\\` to change a range of lines.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '94,97c\\\n        if real_apps is not None:\\n\\\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\\n\\\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()' django/db/migrations/state.py\n```\nThe newlines `\\n` might not work as expected with `c\\`. The `sed` `c` command expects backslashes before newlines.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '94,97c\\\n        if real_apps is not None:\\\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\\\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()' django/db/migrations/state.py\n```\nThis looks better. Let's check indentation.\nThe `if` on line 94 has 8 spaces. The new `if` should also have 8 spaces.\nThe `self.real_apps` on line 95 has 12 spaces. The new `self.real_apps` should have 8 spaces.\nThe `__init__` has 4 spaces. `self.models` has 8. So `if real_apps:` has 8.\nThe new code should be:\n```python\n        if real_apps is not None:\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()\n```\nThe `if` and `self.real_apps` should be at the same indentation level. 8 spaces. The `assert` should be at 12 spaces.\n\nSo the `sed` command should be:\n```bash\nsed -i '94,97c\\\n        if real_apps is not None:\\\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\\\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()' django/db/migrations/state.py\n```\nThis seems wrong. The `assert` is inside the `if`. The `self.real_apps` is outside.\nThe indentation of `self.real_apps` should be 8 spaces.\n\nLet's re-check the python logic.\n```python\n        if real_apps is not None:\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()\n```\nThis is correct. If `real_apps` is `None`, the `if` block is skipped, and `self.real_apps` becomes `set()`.\nIf `real_apps` is a set, the assertion passes, and `self.real_apps` becomes that set.\nIf `real_apps` is not a set (and not `None`), the assertion fails, which is what we want.\n\nThe PR description says \"it can just assert that it's a set when non-None\".\nThe original code is:\n```python\n        if real_apps:\n            self.real_apps = real_apps if isinstance(real_apps, set) else set(real_apps)\n        else:\n            self.real_apps = set()\n```\nThis can be rewritten as `self.real_apps = set(real_apps) if real_apps else set()`.\nAnd since `real_apps` is now a set, it can be `self.real_apps = real_apps if real_apps else set()`, which is `self.real_apps = real_apps or set()`.\n\nSo the logic is:\n1. Assert `real_apps` is a set if not `None`.\n2. Assign `real_apps or set()` to `self.real_apps`.\n\nThe code I wrote does exactly this.\n\nNow for the `sed` command.\n```bash\nsed -i '94,97c\\\n        if real_apps is not None:\\n\\\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\\n\\\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()' django/db/migrations/state.py\n```\nI'm not sure about `\\n` with `c`. Let's try with backslashes.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '94,97c\\\n        if real_apps is not None:\\\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\\\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()' django/db/migrations/state.py\n```\nThis will replace lines 94-97 with 3 new lines.\nLine 1: `        if real_apps is not None:` (8 spaces)\nLine 2: `            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)` (12 spaces)\nLine 3: `        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()` (8 spaces)\n\nThis looks correct. Let's try it.\n\nI'll also adjust the comment on line 93.\n\"Apps to include from main registry, usually unmigrated ones\"\nThe new comment from the PR description is \"Apps to include from main registry, usually unmigrated ones.\".

                "content": "THOUGHT:\nThe relevant code is at line 95:\n`self.real_apps = real_apps if isinstance(real_apps, set) else set(real_apps)`\n\nThe PR description says to replace this with an assertion that `real_apps` is a set when it's not `None`.\n\nSo, I need to change this:\n```python\n        if real_apps:\n            self.real_apps = real_apps if isinstance(real_apps, set) else set(real_apps)\n        else:\n            self.real_apps = set()\n```\n\nto something like this:\n```python\n        if real_apps is not None:\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\n            self.real_apps = real_apps\n        else:\n            self.real_apps = set()\n```\n\nThis can be simplified. The `else` part handles `real_apps` being `None` or an empty container. The original code handles `real_apps` being `None` by going to the `else` block. If `real_apps` is an empty list, it becomes an empty set. If it's `None`, it becomes an empty set.\n\nThe new logic should be:\nIf `real_apps` is not `None`, assert it's a set.\nThen assign `real_apps` to `self.real_apps` if it's not `None`, otherwise assign an empty set.\n\nThis can be written as:\n```python\n        if real_apps is not None:\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\n            self.real_apps = real_apps\n        else:\n            self.real_apps = set()\n```\n\nLet's look at the original code again.\n`if real_apps:`\nThis is true for non-empty lists/sets. If `real_apps` is `None`, it's false.\nIf `real_apps` is `None`, `self.real_apps` becomes `set()`.\nIf `real_apps` is `[]`, `self.real_apps` becomes `set()`.\nIf `real_apps` is `set()`, `self.real_apps` becomes `set()`.\n\nThe logic `real_apps if isinstance(real_apps, set) else set(real_apps)` handles both list and set. The PR says it's always a set now.\n\nSo I can change:\n```python\n        if real_apps:\n            self.real_apps = real_apps if isinstance(real_apps, set) else set(real_apps)\n        else:\n            self.real_apps = set()\n```\nto:\n```python\n        if real_apps is not None:\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()\n```\nThis seems correct. If `real_apps` is `None`, `self.real_apps` becomes `set()`. If `real_apps` is a set (even an empty one), it is assigned to `self.real_apps`. The assertion will check if it's a set when not `None`.\n\nLet's check the logic of `real_apps or set()`.\nIf `real_apps` is `None`, this evaluates to `set()`.\nIf `real_apps` is `{'a', 'b'}`, this evaluates to `{'a', 'b'}`.\nIf `real_apps` is `set()`, this evaluates to `set()`.\nThis seems to cover all cases correctly.\n\nSo the lines to change are 94-97.\n```python\n        # Apps to include from main registry, usually unmigrated ones\n        if real_apps:\n            self.real_apps = real_apps if isinstance(real_apps, set) else set(real_apps)\n        else:\n            self.real_apps = set()\n```\nI will replace these with:\n```python\n        # Apps to include from main registry, usually unmigrated ones.\n        if real_apps is not None:\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()\n```\nThis looks good. I will use `sed` to perform the replacement.\n\nThe original lines are:\n```python\n        if real_apps:\n            self.real_apps = real_apps if isinstance(real_apps, set) else set(real_apps)\n        else:\n            self.real_apps = set()\n```\nThis is spread across multiple lines. I'll need a more powerful `sed` command.\n\nI can replace line 95, and delete 94, 96, 97.\nOr I can try to replace a block.\n\nLet's try to replace line 95 first.\n`sed -i \"95s/.*/            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)/\" django/db/migrations/state.py`\nThis would change line 95. But I need to change more.\n\nLet's try to do this with a single `sed` command with multiple expressions.\nI want to change lines 94-97.\n\nOriginal:\n```\n    94\t        if real_apps:\n    95\t            self.real_apps = real_apps if isinstance(real_apps, set) else set(real_apps)\n    96\t        else:\n    97\t            self.real_apps = set()\n```\n\nNew:\n```\n            if real_apps is not None:\n                assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\n            self.real_apps = real_apps or set()\n```\nThe indentation is important. 12 spaces.\n\nLet's try to construct the `sed` command.\nI can use `c\\` to change a range of lines.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '94,97c\\\n        if real_apps is not None:\\n\\\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\\n\\\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()' django/db/migrations/state.py\n```\nThe newlines `\\n` might not work as expected with `c\\`. The `sed` `c` command expects backslashes before newlines.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '94,97c\\\n        if real_apps is not None:\\\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\\\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()' django/db/migrations/state.py\n```\nThis looks better. Let's check indentation.\nThe `if` on line 94 has 8 spaces. The new `if` should also have 8 spaces.\nThe `self.real_apps` on line 95 has 12 spaces. The new `self.real_apps` should have 8 spaces.\nThe `__init__` has 4 spaces. `self.models` has 8. So `if real_apps:` has 8.\nThe new code should be:\n```python\n        if real_apps is not None:\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()\n```\nThe `if` and `self.real_apps` should be at the same indentation level. 8 spaces. The `assert` should be at 12 spaces.\n\nSo the `sed` command should be:\n```bash\nsed -i '94,97c\\\n        if real_apps is not None:\\\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\\\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()' django/db/migrations/state.py\n```\nThis seems wrong. The `assert` is inside the `if`. The `self.real_apps` is outside.\nThe indentation of `self.real_apps` should be 8 spaces.\n\nLet's re-check the python logic.\n```python\n        if real_apps is not None:\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()\n```\nThis is correct. If `real_apps` is `None`, the `if` block is skipped, and `self.real_apps` becomes `set()`.\nIf `real_apps` is a set, the assertion passes, and `self.real_apps` becomes that set.\nIf `real_apps` is not a set (and not `None`), the assertion fails, which is what we want.\n\nThe PR description says \"it can just assert that it's a set when non-None\".\nThe original code is:\n```python\n        if real_apps:\n            self.real_apps = real_apps if isinstance(real_apps, set) else set(real_apps)\n        else:\n            self.real_apps = set()\n```\nThis can be rewritten as `self.real_apps = set(real_apps) if real_apps else set()`.\nAnd since `real_apps` is now a set, it can be `self.real_apps = real_apps if real_apps else set()`, which is `self.real_apps = real_apps or set()`.\n\nSo the logic is:\n1. Assert `real_apps` is a set if not `None`.\n2. Assign `real_apps or set()` to `self.real_apps`.\n\nThe code I wrote does exactly this.\n\nNow for the `sed` command.\n```bash\nsed -i '94,97c\\\n        if real_apps is not None:\\n\\\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\\n\\\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()' django/db/migrations/state.py\n```\nI'm not sure about `\\n` with `c`. Let's try with backslashes.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '94,97c\\\n        if real_apps is not None:\\\n            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)\\\n        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()' django/db/migrations/state.py\n```\nThis will replace lines 94-97 with 3 new lines.\nLine 1: `        if real_apps is not None:` (8 spaces)\nLine 2: `            assert isinstance(real_apps, set)` (12 spaces)\nLine 3: `        self.real_apps = real_apps or set()` (8 spaces)\n\nThis looks correct. Let's try it.\n\nI'll also adjust the comment on line 93.\n\"Apps to include from main registry, usually unmigrated ones\"\nThe new comment from the PR description is \"Apps to include from main registry, usually unmigrated ones.\". It's the same.
