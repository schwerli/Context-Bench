Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.py\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.py | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.py\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.py\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.py | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.py | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

      "content": "THOUGHT\nHere is the problem, in `SplitArrayWidget.get_context`:\n\n```python\n   140\t        final_attrs = self.build_attrs(attrs)\n   141\t        id_ = final_attrs.get('id')\n   142\t        for i in range(max(len(value), self.size)):\n   143\t            try:\n   144\t                widget_value = value[i]\n   145\t            except IndexError:\n   146\t                widget_value = None\n   147\t            if id_:\n   148\t                final_attrs = {**final_attrs, 'id': '%s_%s' % (id_, i)}\n   149\t            context['widget']['subwidgets'].append(\n   150\t                self.widget.get_context(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, final_attrs)['widget']\n   151\t            )\n```\n\nThe `final_attrs` dictionary is created before the loop (line 140). Inside the loop, it's updated with a new `id` on line 148, but this creates a new dictionary only if `id_` is present. If `id_` is not present, `final_attrs` is passed directly to `self.widget.get_context` on line 150.\n\nWhen `self.widget` is a `CheckboxInput`, its `get_context` method modifies `final_attrs` in place by adding `'checked': True`. In the next iteration of the loop, this modified `final_attrs` is passed again to `get_context` for the next subwidget, which will then also be checked.\n\nThe fix is to pass a copy of `final_attrs` to `self.widget.get_context`.\n\nThe line `final_attrs = {**final_attrs, 'id': '%s_%s' % (id_, i)}` on line 148 already creates a copy, but it's inside an `if id_:` block. If there's no `id`, `final_attrs` is not copied.\n\nA simple fix is to make a copy of `final_attrs` in every iteration.\n\nSo, line 150:\n`self.widget.get_context(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, final_attrs)['widget']`\nshould be changed to something like:\n`self.widget.get_context(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, final_attrs.copy())['widget']`\n\nHowever, line 148 is a bit tricky. It rebinds `final_attrs` to a new dictionary.\nLet's trace it.\n1. `final_attrs` is created on line 140.\n2. Loop starts.\n3. `id_` is checked. If it exists, `final_attrs` is rebound to a *new* dictionary which is a copy of the old one plus the new `id`.\n4. `self.widget.get_context` is called with this `final_attrs`. If it's a `CheckboxInput`, it might modify it.\n5. Next loop iteration.\n6. `id_` is checked. If it exists, `final_attrs` is rebound again. The dictionary from the previous iteration (which might have been modified) is used to create the new one. So the `'checked'` attribute will be carried over.\n\nThe problem is that `final_attrs` is being carried over between iterations.\n\nThe fix is to make sure a fresh copy of attributes is used for each subwidget.\n\nLet's look at line 148 again: `final_attrs = {**final_attrs, 'id': '%s_%s' % (id_, i)}`. This uses dictionary unpacking, which is a Python 3.5+ feature. It creates a new dictionary. The problem is that the `final_attrs` on the right side might already contain `'checked': True` from a previous iteration.\n\nSo, we need to work from a clean copy of `final_attrs` in each iteration.\nThe original `final_attrs` is on line 140. Let's call it `base_attrs`.\n\n```python\n# ...\n        final_attrs = self.build_attrs(attrs)\n        id_ = final_attrs.get('id')\n        for i in range(max(len(value), self.size)):\n            # ...\n            widget_attrs = final_attrs.copy() # make a copy\n            if id_:\n                widget_attrs['id'] = '%s_%s' % (id_, i)\n            context['widget']['subwidgets'].append(\n                self.widget.get_context(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, widget_attrs)['widget']\n            )\n```\nThis seems correct. It makes a fresh copy for each widget.\n\nLet's see how I can apply this with `sed`.\n\nThe original code is:\n```python\n   140\t        final_attrs = self.build_attrs(attrs)\n   141\t        id_ = final_attrs.get('id')\n   142\t        for i in range(max(len(value), self.size)):\n   143\t            try:\n   144\t                widget_value = value[i]\n   145\t            except IndexError:\n   146\t                widget_value = None\n   147\t            if id_:\n   148\t                final_attrs = {**final_attrs, 'id': '%s_%s' % (id_, i)}\n   149\t            context['widget']['subwidgets'].append(\n   150\t                self.widget.get_context(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, final_attrs)['widget']\n   151\t            )\n```\n\nI want to change it to:\n```python\n   140\t        final_attrs = self.build_attrs(attrs)\n   141\t        id_ = final_attrs.get('id')\n   142\t        for i in range(max(len(value), self.size)):\n   143\t            try:\n   144\t                widget_value = value[i]\n   145\t            except IndexError:\n   146\t                widget_value = None\n   147\t            widget_attrs = final_attrs.copy()\n   148\t            if id_:\n   149\t                widget_attrs['id'] = '%s_%s' % (id_, i)\n   150\t            context['widget']['subwidgets'].append(\n   151\t                self.widget.get_context(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, widget_attrs)['widget']\n   152\t            )\n```\nThis looks cleaner.\nI can replace line 148 `final_attrs = {**final_attrs, 'id': '%s_%s' % (id_, i)}` with `widget_attrs['id'] = '%s_%s' % (id_, i)`.\nAnd add `widget_attrs = final_attrs.copy()` before the `if id_:` block.\nAnd change `final_attrs` to `widget_attrs` in the `get_context` call.\n\nLet's try to do this with `sed`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"147i\\\\            widget_attrs = final_attrs.copy()\" django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py && \\\nsed -i \"149s/final_attrs = {**final_attrs, 'id': '%s_%s' % (id_, i)}/widget_attrs['id'] = '%s_%s' % (id_, i)/\" django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py && \\\nsed -i \"152s/final_attrs/widget_attrs/\" django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py\n```\nThe line numbers will shift after the first `sed` command.

What if I just copy `final_attrs` inside the `get_context` call?\n`self.widget.get_context(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, final_attrs.copy())['widget']`\nThis would work if `final_attrs` wasn't updated inside the loop. But it is, on line 148.\n`final_attrs = {**final_attrs, 'id': '%s_%s' % (id_, i)}`\nThis line rebinds `final_attrs` to a new dictionary. But it uses the *old* `final_attrs` which may have been mutated. So the `'checked'` attribute would be carried over.\n\nSo, the problem is that `final_attrs` is being modified and then used as the base for the next iteration.\n\nWhat if I change line 148 to not carry over mutations?\nThe original `final_attrs` is defined on line 140. Let's call it `base_final_attrs`.\nInside the loop, I should always work with a copy of `base_final_attrs`.\n\n```python\n# ...\n        base_final_attrs = self.build_attrs(attrs)\n        id_ = base_final_attrs.get('id')\n        for i in range(max(len(value), self.size)):\n            try:\n                widget_value = value[i]\n            except IndexError:\n                widget_value = None\n            final_attrs = base_final_attrs.copy()\n            if id_:\n                final_attrs['id'] = '%s_%s' % (id_, i)\n            context['widget']['subwidgets'].append(\n                self.widget.get_context(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, final_attrs)['widget']\n            )\n# ...\n```\nThis looks correct and robust. It's a bit more change.\n\nLet's re-examine the original code.\n```python\n   140\t        final_attrs = self.build_attrs(attrs)\n   141\t        id_ = final_attrs.get('id')\n   142\t        for i in range(max(len(value), self.size)):\n   ...\n   147\t            if id_:\n   148\t                final_attrs = {**final_attrs, 'id': '%s_%s' % (id_, i)}\n   149\t            context['widget']['subwidgets'].append(\n   150\t                self.widget.get_context(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, final_attrs)['widget']\n   151\t            )\n```\nIf `id_` is not present, `final_attrs` is passed to `get_context`, mutated, and then reused in the next iteration.\nIf `id_` is present, `final_attrs` is rebound to a new dictionary. The new dictionary is created from the old `final_attrs` (which might be mutated). So the mutation is carried over. Then this new dictionary is passed to `get_context`.\n\nSo, the problem is that `final_attrs` is being carried over.\n\nThe simplest fix is to just copy `final_attrs` before passing it to `get_context`.\n```python\n# ...\n   140\t        final_attrs = self.build_attrs(attrs)\n   141\t        id_ = final_attrs.get('id')\n   142\t        for i in range(max(len(value), self.size)):\n   ...\n   147\t            if id_:\n   148\t                final_attrs = {**final_attrs, 'id': '%s_%s' % (id_, i)}\n   149\t            context['widget']['subwidgets'].append(\n   150\t                self.widget.get_context(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, final_attrs.copy())['widget']\n   151\t            )\n```\nLet's trace this.\nIteration 1: `final_attrs` is passed as a copy. `get_context` mutates the copy. The original `final_attrs` is unchanged.\nIteration 2:\nIf `id_` is present, a new `final_attrs` is created from the *un-mutated* `final_attrs` from the previous iteration. This is correct.\nIf `id_` is not present, the *un-mutated* `final_attrs` is used. A copy is passed to `get_context`. This is also correct.\n\nThis seems to be the most minimal and correct fix. It just adds `.copy()` to one line.\n\nLet's apply this with `sed`. The line is 150.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"150s/final_attrs/final_attrs.copy()/\" django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py\n```\n\nLet's double check the line.\n```python\n   149\t            context['widget']['subwidgets'].append(\n   150\t                self.widget.get_context(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, final_attrs)['widget']\n   151\t            )\n```\nThe change would be:\n```python\n   149\t            context['widget']['subwidgets'].append(\n   150\t                self.widget.get_content(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, final_attrs.copy())['widget']\n   151\t            )\n```\nThis looks correct.\n\nLet's verify the change.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"150s/final_attrs/final_attrs.copy()/\" django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py && cat django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py | nl -ba | sed -n '140,155p'\n```\nWait, I should use `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` when viewing the file.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"150s/final_attrs/final_attrs.copy()/\" django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py\n```\nI'll apply the change first. Then I'll view it to confirm.\n\nI'll execute the `sed` command.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"150s/final_attrs/final_attrs.copy()/\" django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py\n```",

Inside the loop, it's updated with a new `id` on line 148, but this creates a new dictionary only if `id_` is present. If `id_` is not present, `final_attrs` is passed directly to `self.widget.get_context` on line 150.\n\nWhen `self.widget` is a `CheckboxInput`, its `get_context` method modifies `final_attrs` in place by adding `'checked': True`. In the next iteration of the loop, this modified `final_attrs` is passed again to `get_context` for the next subwidget, which will then also be checked.\n\nThe fix is to pass a copy of `final_attrs` to `self.widget.get_context`.\n\nThe line `final_attrs = {**final_attrs, 'id': '%s_%s' % (id_, i)}` on line 148 already creates a copy, but it's inside an `if id_:` block. If there's no `id`, `final_attrs` is not copied.\n\nA simple fix is to make a copy of `final_attrs` in every iteration.\n\nSo, line 150:\n`self.widget.get_context(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, final_attrs)['widget']`\nshould be changed to something like:\n`self.widget.get_context(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, final_attrs.copy())['widget']`\n\nHowever, line 148 is a bit tricky. It rebinds `final_attrs` to a new dictionary.\nLet's trace it.\n1. `final_attrs` is created on line 140.\n2. Loop starts.\n3. `id_` is checked. If it exists, `final_attrs` is rebound to a *new* dictionary which is a copy of the old one plus the new `id`.\n4. `self.widget.get_context` is called with this `final_attrs`. If it's a `CheckboxInput`, it might modify it.\n5. Next loop iteration.\n6. `id_` is checked. If it exists, `final_attrs` is rebound again. The dictionary from the previous iteration (which might have been modified) is used to create the new one. So the `'checked'` attribute will be carried over.\n\nThe problem is that `final_attrs` is being carried over between iterations.\n\nThe fix is to make sure a fresh copy of attributes is used for each subwidget.\n\nLet's look at line 148 again: `final_attrs = {**final_attrs, 'id': '%s_%s' % (id_, i)}`. This uses dictionary unpacking, which is a Python 3.5+ feature. It creates a new dictionary. The problem is that the `final_attrs` on the right side might already contain `'checked': True` from a previous iteration.\n\nSo, we need to work from a clean copy of `final_attrs` in each iteration.\nThe original `final_attrs` is on line 140. Let's call it `base_attrs`.\n\n```python\n# ...\n        final_attrs = self.build_attrs(attrs)\n        id_ = final_attrs.get('id')\n        for i in range(max(len(value), self.size)):\n            # ...\n            widget_attrs = final_attrs.copy() # make a copy\n            if id_:\n                widget_attrs['id'] = '%s_%s' % (id_, i)\n            context['widget']['subwidgets'].append(\n                self.widget.get_context(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, widget_attrs)['widget']\n            )\n```\nThis seems correct.

Then this new dictionary is passed to `get_context`.\n\nSo, the problem is that `final_attrs` is being carried over.\n\nThe simplest fix is to just copy `final_attrs` before passing it to `get_context`.\n```python\n# ...\n   140\t        final_attrs = self.build_attrs(attrs)\n   141\t        id_ = final_attrs.get('id')\n   142\t        for i in range(max(len(value), self.size)):\n   ...\n   147\t            if id_:\n   148\t                final_attrs = {**final_attrs, 'id': '%s_%s' % (id_, i)}\n   149\t            context['widget']['subwidgets'].append(\n   150\t                self.widget.get_context(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, final_attrs.copy())['widget']\n   151\t            )\n```\nLet's trace this.\nIteration 1: `final_attrs` is passed as a copy. `get_context` mutates the copy. The original `final_attrs` is unchanged.\nIteration 2:\nIf `id_` is present, a new `final_attrs` is created from the *un-mutated* `final_attrs` from the previous iteration. This is correct.\nIf `id_` is not present, the *un-mutated* `final_attrs` is used. A copy is passed to `get_context`. This is also correct.\n\nThis seems to be the most minimal and correct fix. It just adds `.copy()` to one line.\n\nLet's apply this with `sed`. The line is 150.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"150s/final_attrs/final_attrs.copy()/\" django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py\n```\n\nLet's double check the line.\n```python\n   149\t            context['widget']['subwidgets'].append(\n   150\t                self.widget.get_context(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, final_attrs)['widget']\n   151\t            )\n```\nThe change would be:\n```python\n   149\t            context['widget']['subwidgets'].append(\n   150\t                self.widget.get_content(name + '_%s' % i, widget_value, final_attrs.copy())['widget']\n   151\t            )\n```\nThis looks correct.\n\nLet's verify the change.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"150s/final_attrs/final_attrs.copy()/\" django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py && cat django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py | nl -ba | sed -n '140,155p'\n```\nWait, I should use `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` when viewing the file.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"150s/final_attrs/final_attrs.copy()/\" django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py\n```\nI'll apply the change first. Then I'll view it to confirm.\n\nI'll execute the `sed` command.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"150s/final_attrs/final_attrs.copy()/\" django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py\n```",
