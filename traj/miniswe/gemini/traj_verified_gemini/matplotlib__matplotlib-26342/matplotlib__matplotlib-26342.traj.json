Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.py\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.py | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.py\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.py\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.py | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.py | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

For example, when a single\n    41\t    path is being drawn repeatedly at different offsets, the renderer can\n    42\t    typically execute a ``draw_marker()`` call much more efficiently than a\n    43\t    series of repeated calls to ``draw_path()`` with the offsets put in\n    44\t    one-by-one.\n    45\t\n    46\t    Most properties of a collection can be configured per-element. Therefore,\n    47\t    Collections have \"plural\" versions of many of the properties of a `.Patch`\n    48\t    (e.g. `.Collection.get_paths` instead of `.Patch.get_path`). Exceptions are\n    49\t    the *zorder*, *hatch*, *pickradius*, *capstyle* and *joinstyle* properties,\n    50\t    which can only be set globally for the whole collection.\n    51\t\n    52\t    Besides these exceptions, all properties can be specified as single values\n    53\t    (applying to all elements) or sequences of values.

The cartopy use case transforms existing paths, so the number of paths should not change.\n\nThe implementation I proposed seems reasonable. It updates `_paths` and cleans up the deprecated `collections` property if it was used.\n\nI will add the `set_paths` method to `ContourSet` class in `lib/matplotlib/contour.py`.\nIt should be placed after `get_paths`. `get_paths` is inherited from `Collection` but `ContourSet` can override it. Let's check if it does.\nI grepped for `def get_paths` in `contour.py` before and got no result. So it's inherited.\n`Collection` has `set_paths` that raises `NotImplementedError`. `ContourSet` should override it.\n\nI'll place the new method next to other property-like methods. A good place would be after `__init__` and before the properties. Or with other public methods. Let's look for a good spot.\n\nLooking at the file structure, there is `_process_args`, then properties, then `_process_levels`, etc.\nI'll put it after `get_paths` from the parent class. Since it's not in this file, I'll put it somewhere logical.\n`ContourSet` inherits `get_paths` from `Collection`. `Collection` has a `set_paths` that needs to be implemented. So I'm overriding it.\n\nI'll put it after the `__init__` method, after all the processing methods called from `__init__`.\nThe `collections` property is at line 948.\nLet's put it before that.\n\n```python\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\n        \"\"\"\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\n        \"\"\"\n        self._paths = paths\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\n                col.remove()\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\n            # made it invisible.\n            self.set_visible(True)\n\n```\nThis looks reasonable. The docstring explains what it does. It handles the `_old_style_split_collections` case.\n\nThe problem description says `paths[:] = transformed_paths` works. This means `get_paths()` returns a list. My implementation `self._paths = paths` assumes `paths` is a list of `Path` objects, which is correct.\n\nThe `collections` property is deprecated since 3.8. The code I'm writing should be correct for current and future versions. Handling the invalidation of `_old_style_split_collections` is good practice.\n\nI'll add this method at line 934, before the `allsegs` property.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '934i\\\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\\n\\\n        \"\"\"\\n\\\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\\n\\\n\\n\\\n        Parameters\\n\\\n        ----------\\n\\\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\\n\\\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\\n\\\n        \"\"\"\\n\\\n        self._paths = paths\\n\\\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\\n\\\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\\n\\\n                col.remove()\\n\\\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\\n\\\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\\n\\\n            # made it invisible.\\n\\\n            self.set_visible(True)\\n\\\n\n' ./lib/matplotlib/contour.py\n```\n\nI need to be careful with indentation. `sed` can be tricky.\nLet's check the indentation of the `_process_args` method at line 903. It's 4 spaces.\nMy `sed` command needs to insert text with 4 spaces indentation for the method definition, and more for the body.\n\n```python\n    def _process_args(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        ...\n```\nThe indentation is 4 spaces.\n\nMy `sed` script:\n```\n934i\\\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\\n\\\n        \"\"\"\\n\\\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\\n\\\n\\n\\\n        Parameters\\n\\\n        ----------\\n\\\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\\n\\\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\\n\\\n        \"\"\"\\n\\\n        self._paths = paths\\n\\\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\\n\\\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\\n\\\n                col.remove()\\n\\\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\\n\\\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\\n\\\n            # made it invisible.\\n\\\n            self.set_visible(True)\\n\\\n\n```\nThe first line `def set_paths...` needs 4 spaces.\nThe `sed` `i` command will insert text. The spaces must be part of the inserted text.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '934i\\\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\\n\\\n        \"\"\"\\n\\\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\\n\\\n\\n\\\n        Parameters\\n\\\n        ----------\\n\\\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\\n\\\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\\n\\\n        \"\"\"\\n\\\n        self._paths = paths\\n\\\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\\n\\\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\\n\\\n                col.remove()\\n\\\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\\n\\\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\\n\\\n            # made it invisible.\\n\\\n            self.set_visible(True)\\n\n' ./lib/matplotlib/contour.py\n```\nI need to escape the newline characters for `sed`.\nThe `\\n` is not needed if I use separate lines.\nLet's try a different approach with `cat` and `ed` or just a more careful `sed`.\n\nUsing `sed` with `i` and literal newlines is standard.\nThe indentation needs to be correct.\n4 spaces for `def`.\n8 for `\"\"\"` and method body.\n12 for `if` body.\n12 for comment.\n8 for `self.set_visible`.\n\nMy python code block:\n```python\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\n        \"\"\"\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\n        \"\"\"\n        self._paths = paths\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\n                col.remove()\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\n            # made it invisible.\n            self.set_visible(True)\n\n```\nThe indentation of the comment should be 12 spaces.\n`# Make...`\n`self.set_visible(True)` should be 8 spaces.\n\nCorrected python code block:\n```python\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\n        \"\"\"\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\n        \"\"\"\n        self._paths = paths\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\n                col.remove()\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\n            # made it invisible.\n            self.set_visible(True)\n```\nThe comment is about `set_visible`, so it should be at the same level or inside the `if`. It's about why `set_visible` is called, so it should be right before it.\nThe logic is: if `_old_style_split_collections` existed, then `self.set_visible(False)` was called. So we need to set it back to `True`. This should be inside the `if`.\n\nCorrected python code block again:\n```python\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\n        \"\"\"\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\n        \"\"\"\n        self._paths = paths\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\n                col.remove()\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\n            # made it invisible.\n            self.set_visible(True)\n```\nThe `self.set_visible(True)` is correctly indented at 12 spaces, inside the `if`.\nWait, no. `del` is at 12. `self.set_visible` should be at 12 too.\nThe comment should be at 12.\n\n```python\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\n        \"\"\"\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\n        \"\"\"\n        self._paths = paths\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\n                col.remove()\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\n            # made it invisible.\n            self.set_visible(True)\n```\nThis looks right.\n`def` - 4 spaces\n`\"\"\"` - 8 spaces\n`self._paths = paths` - 8 spaces\n`if ...` - 8 spaces\n`for ...` - 12 spaces\n`col.remove()` - 16 spaces\n`del ...` - 12 spaces\n`# ...` - 12 spaces\n`self.set_visible(True)` - 12 spaces\n\nThis seems correct.

I should insert before 935.\nThe `_process_args` method ends at 933.\nSo inserting at 935 is fine. It will be before `allsegs`.\n\nLet's check the indentation of `allsegs`. It's 4 spaces. My `def` is also 4 spaces. Perfect.\n\nFinal check of the `sed` command.\n```bash\nsed -i '935i\\\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\\\n\\\n        Parameters\\\n        ----------\\\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\\\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        self._paths = paths\\\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\\\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\\\n                col.remove()\\\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\\\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\\\n            # made it invisible.\\\n            self.set_visible(True)\\\n\\\n\n' ./lib/matplotlib/contour.py\n```\nThe indentation of `del` and `set_visible` should be 12 spaces.\n`for` is 12. `col.remove()` is 16. `del` should be 12.\nMy python block:\n```python\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\n                col.remove()\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\n            # made it invisible.\n            self.set_visible(True)\n```\nThis is wrong. `del` should be outside the for loop.\nAnd `set_visible` too.\nThe `for` loop iterates and removes.

It's after.\n`for` loop is at 12 spaces. `col.remove()` is at 16.\n`del` is at 12. This is correct. It's after the `for` loop, but inside the `if`.\n`#` comment is at 12. `self.set_visible` is at 12. This is also correct.\n\nMy previous analysis of indentation was wrong.\n`if` is at 8.\n`for` is at 12.\n`col.remove()` is at 16.\n`del` is at 12.\n`#` is at 12.\n`self.set_visible` is at 12.\nThis is correct.\n\nLet's re-check the `sed` command.\n```bash\nsed -i '935i\\\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\\\n\\\n        Parameters\\\n        ----------\\\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\\\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        self._paths = paths\\\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\\\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\\\n                col.remove()\\\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\\\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\\\n            # made it invisible.\\\n            self.set_visible(True)\\\n\\\n\n' ./lib/matplotlib/contour.py\n```\nThis looks correct.

I'll execute it.THOUGHT:\nThe goal is to add a `set_paths` method to the `ContourSet` class in `lib/matplotlib/contour.py`. This is to provide a proper API for what is currently done with a workaround (`paths[:] = new_paths`).\n\n1.  **Locate `ContourSet`**: I've found `ContourSet` in `lib/matplotlib/contour.py`.\n2.  **Analyze `ContourSet` and its parent `Collection`**: `ContourSet` inherits from `matplotlib.collections.Collection`. The parent `Collection` class has a `get_paths` method which returns `self._paths`, and a `set_paths` method that raises `NotImplementedError`. This confirms that `ContourSet` is the right place to implement `set_paths`.\n3.  **Understand `_paths`**: In `ContourSet`, `self._paths` is a list of `matplotlib.path.Path` objects, created during initialization. The workaround `paths[:] = ...` works because `get_paths()` returns this list.\n4.  **Design `set_paths`**: The new method should assign the new list of paths to `self._paths`. However, I've noticed a deprecated property `collections` which, when accessed, creates a set of `PathCollection` objects from `self._paths`, adds them to the axes, and caches them in `self._old_style_split_collections`. If `set_paths` is called after `collections` has been accessed, these old collections would remain on the axes, leading to incorrect plots.\n5.  **Robust Implementation**: To make the implementation robust, `set_paths` should check for the existence of `_old_style_split_collections`. If it exists, it should remove the old collections from the axes and delete the cached attribute. Accessing the `collections` property also makes the `ContourSet` itself invisible, so my new method should make it visible again if it cleans up the old collections.\n6.  **Code Placement**: I'll add the new method inside the `ContourSet` class definition. A good spot is before the properties section, which starts around line 935. The indentation should be 4 spaces for the method definition, consistent with other methods in the class.\n\nThe implementation will be:\n```python\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\n        \"\"\"\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\n        \"\"\"\n        self._paths = paths\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\n                col.remove()\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\n            # made it invisible.\n            self.set_visible(True)\n```\nThis handles the path update and the invalidation of the deprecated `collections` property. I will use `sed` to insert this code into `lib/matplotlib/contour.py` at line 935.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '935i\\\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\\\n\\\n        Parameters\\\n        ----------\\\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\\\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        self._paths = paths\\\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\\\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\\\n                col.remove()\\\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\\\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\\\n            # made it invisible.\\\n            self.set_visible(True)\\\n\\\n\n' ./lib/matplotlib/contour.py\n```",

                "content": "THOUGHT:\n`self._paths` is used in a few places:\n- `get_label_width`: `self._paths[idx_level_min]`\n- `get_label_clabeltext`: `self._paths[icon]`\n- `__init__`: initialization\n- `collections` property: iteration\n- `get_transform`: `len(self._paths)`\n- `_make_paths_from_segs`: initialization\n- `_make_paths_from_contour_generator`: initialization\n- `clabel`: `len(self._paths)`, `self._paths[idx_level]`\n- `draw`: `self._paths`\n\nThe usage in `clabel` and `get_label_*` methods suggests that the number of paths is related to the number of levels. The cartopy use case transforms existing paths, so the number of paths should not change.\n\nThe implementation I proposed seems reasonable. It updates `_paths` and cleans up the deprecated `collections` property if it was used.\n\nI will add the `set_paths` method to `ContourSet` class in `lib/matplotlib/contour.py`.\nIt should be placed after `get_paths`. `get_paths` is inherited from `Collection` but `ContourSet` can override it. Let's check if it does.\nI grepped for `def get_paths` in `contour.py` before and got no result. So it's inherited.\n`Collection` has `set_paths` that raises `NotImplementedError`. `ContourSet` should override it.\n\nI'll place the new method next to other property-like methods. A good place would be after `__init__` and before the properties. Or with other public methods. Let's look for a good spot.\n\nLooking at the file structure, there is `_process_args`, then properties, then `_process_levels`, etc.\nI'll put it after `get_paths` from the parent class. Since it's not in this file, I'll put it somewhere logical.\n`ContourSet` inherits `get_paths` from `Collection`. `Collection` has a `set_paths` that needs to be implemented. So I'm overriding it.\n\nI'll put it after the `__init__` method, after all the processing methods called from `__init__`.\nThe `collections` property is at line 948.\nLet's put it before that.\n\n```python\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\n        \"\"\"\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\n        \"\"\"\n        self._paths = paths\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\n                col.remove()\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\n            # made it invisible.\n            self.set_visible(True)\n\n```\nThis looks reasonable. The docstring explains what it does. It handles the `_old_style_split_collections` case.\n\nThe problem description says `paths[:] = transformed_paths` works. This means `get_paths()` returns a list. My implementation `self._paths = paths` assumes `paths` is a list of `Path` objects, which is correct.\n\nThe `collections` property is deprecated since 3.8. The code I'm writing should be correct for current and future versions. Handling the invalidation of `_old_style_split_collections` is good practice.\n\nI'll add this method at line 934, before the `allsegs` property.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '934i\\\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\\n\\\n        \"\"\"\\n\\\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\\n\\\n\\n\\\n        Parameters\\n\\\n        ----------\\n\\\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\\n\\\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\\n\\\n        \"\"\"\\n\\\n        self._paths = paths\\n\\\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\\n\\\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\\n\\\n                col.remove()\\n\\\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\\n\\\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\\n\\\n            # made it invisible.\\n\\\n            self.set_visible(True)\\n\\\n\n' ./lib/matplotlib/contour.py\n```\n\nI need to be careful with indentation. `sed` can be tricky.\nLet's check the indentation of the `_process_args` method at line 903. It's 4 spaces.\nMy `sed` command needs to insert text with 4 spaces indentation for the method definition, and more for the body.\n\n```python\n    def _process_args(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        ...\n```\nThe indentation is 4 spaces.\n\nMy `sed` script:\n```\n934i\\\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\\n\\\n        \"\"\"\\n\\\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\\n\\\n\\n\\\n        Parameters\\n\\\n        ----------\\n\\\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\\n\\\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\\n\\\n        \"\"\"\\n\\\n        self._paths = paths\\n\\\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\\n\\\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\\n\\\n                col.remove()\\n\\\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\\n\\\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\\n\\\n            # made it invisible.\\n\\\n            self.set_visible(True)\\n\\\n\n```\nThe first line `def set_paths...` needs 4 spaces.\nThe `sed` `i` command will insert text.

It's about why `set_visible` is called, so it should be right before it.\nThe logic is: if `_old_style_split_collections` existed, then `self.set_visible(False)` was called. So we need to set it back to `True`. This should be inside the `if`.\n\nCorrected python code block again:\n```python\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\n        \"\"\"\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\n        \"\"\"\n        self._paths = paths\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\n                col.remove()\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\n            # made it invisible.\n            self.set_visible(True)\n```\nThe `self.set_visible(True)` is correctly indented at 12 spaces, inside the `if`.\nWait, no. `del` is at 12. `self.set_visible` should be at 12 too.\nThe comment should be at 12.\n\n```python\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\n        \"\"\"\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\n        \"\"\"\n        self._paths = paths\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\n                col.remove()\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\n            # made it invisible.\n            self.set_visible(True)\n```\nThis looks right.\n`def` - 4 spaces\n`\"\"\"` - 8 spaces\n`self._paths = paths` - 8 spaces\n`if ...` - 8 spaces\n`for ...` - 12 spaces\n`col.remove()` - 16 spaces\n`del ...` - 12 spaces\n`# ...` - 12 spaces\n`self.set_visible(True)` - 12 spaces\n\nThis seems correct.

Perfect.\n\nFinal check of the `sed` command.\n```bash\nsed -i '935i\\\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\\\n\\\n        Parameters\\\n        ----------\\\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\\\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        self._paths = paths\\\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\\\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\\\n                col.remove()\\\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\\\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\\\n            # made it invisible.\\\n            self.set_visible(True)\\\n\\\n\n' ./lib/matplotlib/contour.py\n```\nThe indentation of `del` and `set_visible` should be 12 spaces.\n`for` is 12. `col.remove()` is 16. `del` should be 12.\nMy python block:\n```python\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\n                col.remove()\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\n            # made it invisible.\n            self.set_visible(True)\n```\nThis is wrong. `del` should be outside the for loop.\nAnd `set_visible` too.\nThe `for` loop iterates and removes. After the loop, we delete the attribute.\nThe indentation of my python code was wrong.\n\nCorrected python block:\n```python\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\n        \"\"\"\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\n        \"\"\"\n        self._paths = paths\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\n                col.remove()\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\n            # made it invisible.\n            self.set_visible(True)\n```\nWait, `del` is not in the loop. It's after.\n`for` loop is at 12 spaces. `col.remove()` is at 16.\n`del` is at 12. This is correct. It's after the `for` loop, but inside the `if`.\n`#` comment is at 12. `self.set_visible` is at 12. This is also correct.\n\nMy previous analysis of indentation was wrong.\n`if` is at 8.\n`for` is at 12.\n`col.remove()` is at 16.\n`del` is at 12.\n`#` is at 12.\n`self.set_visible` is at 12.\nThis is correct.\n\nLet's re-check the `sed` command.\n```bash\nsed -i '935i\\\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\\\n\\\n        Parameters\\\n        ----------\\\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\\\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        self._paths = paths\\\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\\\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\\\n                col.remove()\\\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\\\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\\\n            # made it invisible.\\\n            self.set_visible(True)\\\n\\\n\n' ./lib/matplotlib/contour.py\n```\nThis looks correct. I will execute it.\n\nAfter this, I should verify the change.\nI can't really run cartopy, but I can check the file content.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '935i\\\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\\\n\\\n        Parameters\\\n        ----------\\\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\\\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        self._paths = paths\\\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\\\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\\\n                col.remove()\\\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\\\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\\\n            # made it invisible.\\\n            self.set_visible(True)\\\n\\\n' ./lib/matplotlib/contour.py\n```\nThe command looks good. I'll execute it.THOUGHT:\nThe goal is to add a `set_paths` method to the `ContourSet` class in `lib/matplotlib/contour.py`. This is to provide a proper API for what is currently done with a workaround (`paths[:] = new_paths`).\n\n1.  **Locate `ContourSet`**: I've found `ContourSet` in `lib/matplotlib/contour.py`.\n2.  **Analyze `ContourSet` and its parent `Collection`**: `ContourSet` inherits from `matplotlib.collections.Collection`. The parent `Collection` class has a `get_paths` method which returns `self._paths`, and a `set_paths` method that raises `NotImplementedError`. This confirms that `ContourSet` is the right place to implement `set_paths`.\n3.  **Understand `_paths`**: In `ContourSet`, `self._paths` is a list of `matplotlib.path.Path` objects, created during initialization. The workaround `paths[:] = ...` works because `get_paths()` returns this list.\n4.  **Design `set_paths`**: The new method should assign the new list of paths to `self._paths`. However, I've noticed a deprecated property `collections` which, when accessed, creates a set of `PathCollection` objects from `self._paths`, adds them to the axes, and caches them in `self._old_style_split_collections`. If `set_paths` is called after `collections` has been accessed, these old collections would remain on the axes, leading to incorrect plots.\n5.  **Robust Implementation**: To make the implementation robust, `set_paths` should check for the existence of `_old_style_split_collections`. If it exists, it should remove the old collections from the axes and delete the cached attribute. Accessing the `collections` property also makes the `ContourSet` itself invisible, so my new method should make it visible again if it cleans up the old collections.\n6.  **Code Placement**: I'll add the new method inside the `ContourSet` class definition. A good spot is before the properties section, which starts around line 935. The indentation should be 4 spaces for the method definition, consistent with other methods in the class.\n\nThe implementation will be:\n```python\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\n        \"\"\"\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\n        \"\"\"\n        self._paths = paths\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\n                col.remove()\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\n            # made it invisible.\n            self.set_visible(True)\n```\nThis handles the path update and the invalidation of the deprecated `collections` property. I will use `sed` to insert this code into `lib/matplotlib/contour.py` at line 935.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '935i\\\n    def set_paths(self, paths):\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        Set the paths for this contour set.\\\n\\\n        Parameters\\\n        ----------\\\n        paths : list of :class:`~matplotlib.path.Path`\\\n            The paths to use for this contour set.\\\n        \"\"\"\\\n        self._paths = paths\\\n        if hasattr(self, \"_old_style_split_collections\"):\\\n            for col in self._old_style_split_collections:\\\n                col.remove()\\\n            del self._old_style_split_collections\\\n            # Make the ContourSet visible again, as accessing .collections\\\n            # made it invisible.\\\n            self.set_visible(True)\\\n\\\n\n' ./lib/matplotlib/contour.py\n```",
