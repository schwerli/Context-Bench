The big issue though is that if you go into a multi-line literal, and then try to type the closing backtick, vscode inserts two backticks, leaving you with three.\r\n\r\nFor example if I type:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst Button = styled.button`\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect to have the closing tick automatically inserted and the cursor in between them. Instead it just stops there. If I then go on to enter some css and then manually enter the closing backtick, I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst Button = styled.button`\r\n  background: papayawhip;\r\n  color: green;\r\n``\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then have to manually delete the third backtick, as if I delete the second, the whole pair is deleted because of the auto-close rules.\r\n\r\nI have verified this is happening on Mac and Windows 10, with extensions enabled and disabled, and in the Insiders build.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.28.1 (3368db6750222d319c851f6d90eb619d886e08f5, 2018-10-11T18:07:48.477Z)\r\nOS version: Darwin x64 18.0.0\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>System Info</summary>\r\n\r\n|Item|Value|\r\n|---|---|\r\n|CPUs|Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7820HQ CPU @ 2.90GHz (8 x 2900)|\r\n|GPU Status|2d_canvas: enabled<br>checker_imaging: disabled_off<br>flash_3d: enabled<br>flash_stage3d: enabled<br>flash_stage3d_baseline: enabled<br>gpu_compositing: enabled<br>multiple_raster_threads: enabled_on<br>native_gpu_memory_buffers: enabled<br>rasterization: enabled<br>video_decode: enabled<br>video_encode: enabled<br>webgl: enabled<br>webgl2: enabled|\r\n|Load (avg)|1, 2, 2|\r\n|Memory (System)|16.00GB (0.87GB free)|\r\n|Process Argv|-psn_0_1007862|\r\n|Screen Reader|no|\r\n|VM|17%|\r\n\r\n</details><details><summary>Extensions (20)</summary>\r\n\r\nExtension|Author (truncated)|Version\r\n---|---|---\r\nActiveFileInStatusBar|Ros|1.0.3\r\nbetter-comments|aar|2.0.2\r\nbracket-pair-colorizer|Coe|1.0.60\r\nvscode-eslint|dba|1.6.1\r\nes7-react-js-snippets|dsz|1.8.7\r\nprettier-vscode|esb|1.6.1\r\ndotnet-test-explorer|for|0.5.4\r\nvscode-styled-components|jpo|0.0.22\r\nmssql|ms-|1.4.0\r\npython|ms-|2018.9.0\r\ncsharp|ms-|1.16.2\r\nvsliveshare|ms-|0.3.790\r\nindent-rainbow|ode|7.2.4\r\nvscode-docker|Pet|0.3.1\r\nseti-icons|qin|0.1.3\r\ncode-settings-sync|Sha|3.1.2\r\nmdx|sil|0.1.0\r\nvscode-status-bar-format-toggle|tom|1.4.0\r\nvim|vsc|0.16.10\r\nquokka-vscode|Wal|1.0.154\r\n\r\n(3 theme extensions excluded)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<!-- generated by issue reporter -->\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.

      "content": "THOUGHT:\nThe user is experiencing issues with backtick auto-closing for tagged template literals in JavaScript/JSX.\nThere are two problems described:\n1. When typing the opening backtick for a tagged template literal (e.g., `styled.button``), it does not auto-close as expected.\n2. When inside a multi-line template literal and manually typing the closing backtick, it inserts two backticks (e.g., ` `` `), resulting in a total of three backticks.\n\nLet's analyze the second problem first, as it seems more straightforward. The insertion of two backticks (` `` `) when one is typed means that auto-closing is being triggered. Auto-closing for pairs like backticks should be disabled when the cursor is already inside a \"string-like\" context. The language configuration file `extensions/typescript-basics/language-configuration.json` defines these rules.\n\nLooking at the file, the rule for backticks is:\n`{ \"open\": \"`\", \"close\": \"`\", \"notIn\": [\"string\", \"comment\"] }`\n\nThis rule prevents auto-closing inside scopes named `string` or `comment`. The fact that auto-closing *is* happening inside a template literal suggests that the scope for template literal content is not being recognized as a `string`.\n\nBy inspecting the TextMate grammars for JavaScript (`JavaScript.tmLanguage.json`) and TypeScript (`TypeScript.tmLanguage.json`) in `extensions/typescript-basics/syntaxes/`, I can see that template literal contents are scoped as `string.template.js` and `string.template.ts` respectively.\n\nIt appears the `notIn` condition with just `\"string\"` is not sufficient to cover these more specific template string scopes. To fix this, I should add `string.template` to the `notIn` array. This will match both `string.template.js` and `string.template.ts` if scope matching works on prefixes, which is standard for TextMate scopes. This should solve the second problem, which the user described as \"the big issue\".\n\nThe new rule would be:\n`{ \"open\": \"`\", \"close\": \"`\", \"notIn\": [\"string\", \"comment\", \"string.template\"] }`\n\nNow for the first problem: the opening backtick of a tagged template literal not auto-closing. This is puzzling because the context before the backtick (e.g., `styled.button`) is code, not a string or comment. According to the rule, it *should* auto-close. The user says it used to work and \"recently changed\". This suggests the introduction of the `notIn` clause for backticks might be the \"recent change\" and it was flawed.\n\nIt's possible that fixing the `notIn` clause as described above might indirectly resolve the first issue. A faulty configuration could potentially confuse the editor's parsing/state-machine for determining the current context.

                "content": "THOUGHT:\nThe user is experiencing issues with backtick auto-closing for tagged template literals in JavaScript/JSX.\nThere are two problems described:\n1. When typing the opening backtick for a tagged template literal (e.g., `styled.button``), it does not auto-close as expected.\n2. When inside a multi-line template literal and manually typing the closing backtick, it inserts two backticks (e.g., ` `` `), resulting in a total of three backticks.\n\nLet's analyze the second problem first, as it seems more straightforward. The insertion of two backticks (` `` `) when one is typed means that auto-closing is being triggered. Auto-closing for pairs like backticks should be disabled when the cursor is already inside a \"string-like\" context. The language configuration file `extensions/typescript-basics/language-configuration.json` defines these rules.\n\nLooking at the file, the rule for backticks is:\n`{ \"open\": \"`\", \"close\": \"`\", \"notIn\": [\"string\", \"comment\"] }`\n\nThis rule prevents auto-closing inside scopes named `string` or `comment`. The fact that auto-closing *is* happening inside a template literal suggests that the scope for template literal content is not being recognized as a `string`.\n\nBy inspecting the TextMate grammars for JavaScript (`JavaScript.tmLanguage.json`) and TypeScript (`TypeScript.tmLanguage.json`) in `extensions/typescript-basics/syntaxes/`, I can see that template literal contents are scoped as `string.template.js` and `string.template.ts` respectively.\n\nIt appears the `notIn` condition with just `\"string\"` is not sufficient to cover these more specific template string scopes. To fix this, I should add `string.template` to the `notIn` array. This will match both `string.template.js` and `string.template.ts` if scope matching works on prefixes, which is standard for TextMate scopes. This should solve the second problem, which the user described as \"the big issue\".\n\nThe new rule would be:\n`{ \"open\": \"`\", \"close\": \"`\", \"notIn\": [\"string\", \"comment\", \"string.template\"] }`\n\nNow for the first problem: the opening backtick of a tagged template literal not auto-closing. This is puzzling because the context before the backtick (e.g., `styled.button`) is code, not a string or comment. According to the rule, it *should* auto-close. The user says it used to work and \"recently changed\". This suggests the introduction of the `notIn` clause for backticks might be the \"recent change\" and it was flawed.\n\nIt's possible that fixing the `notIn` clause as described above might indirectly resolve the first issue.
