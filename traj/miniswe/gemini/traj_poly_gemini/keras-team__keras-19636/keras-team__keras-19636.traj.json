Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in the current working directory (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.py\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.py | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.py\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.py\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.py | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.py | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "THOUGHT:The TensorFlow backend's `convert_to_tensor` uses `tf.convert_to_tensor`. The documentation for `tf.convert_to_tensor` states that if `dtype` is `None`, it infers the dtype from the input `value`. This is the behavior we want. When an integer numpy array is passed, it should create an integer tensor.\n\nSo, my proposed change to `keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py` is correct. I need to add a check for `is_float_dtype` before casting numpy arrays.\n\nThe current implementation is:\n```python\n    elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nThis unconditionally casts to `dtype`, which is the compute_dtype of the policy.\n\nI will change it to:\n```python\n    elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n        # This path is for numpy array inputs.\n        if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype:\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nHowever, `ops.convert_to_tensor(x)` will still convert it to a tensor. What if `x` is already a tensor? The first `if backend.is_tensor(x)` block should have handled it. `hasattr(x, \"__array__\")` is true for numpy arrays, and also for TensorFlow tensors. This could be a problem.\n\nLet's re-read `convert_input`.\n```python\ndef convert_input(self, x, autocast, dtype):\n    dtype = backend.standardize_dtype(dtype)\n    if backend.is_tensor(x):\n        if (\n            autocast\n            and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n            and x.dtype != dtype\n        ):\n            x = backend.cast(x, dtype=dtype)\n        return x\n    elif backend.is_keras_tensor(x):\n        ...\n        return x\n    elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n    return x\n```\n`backend.is_tensor(x)` for tensorflow backend checks `isinstance(x, (tf.Tensor, tf.Variable))`. `tf.Tensor` has an `__array__` method. So a `tf.Tensor` will enter the first `if` block and not the `elif`. So the `elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\")` is mainly for numpy arrays. This is good.\n\nSo, the change should be to add a condition.\nI will also need to import `backend` inside the method, or check if it's already available. It is available from the top of the file.\n\nThe logic should be:\n```python\n    elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n        # This path is for numpy array inputs.\n        # We only cast it to the policy's compute dtype if it's a float.\n        if (\n            autocast\n            and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n            and x.dtype != dtype\n        ):\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nThis seems a bit redundant with the first block. Let's look at the first block again.\n```python\n    if backend.is_tensor(x):\n        if (\n            autocast\n            and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n            and x.dtype != dtype\n        ):\n            x = backend.cast(x, dtype=dtype)\n        return x\n```\nThis block returns `x` if it's a tensor. If it's a tensor and needs casting, it's cast and returned. If not, it's returned as is.\n\nMy proposed change for `__array__` is:\n```python\n    elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n        if (\n            autocast\n            and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n            and x.dtype != dtype\n        ):\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nThis looks correct. It converts to tensor, but only casts to policy `dtype` if the original array is float. If it's an integer array, it will be converted to an integer tensor, preserving its dtype.\n\nBut wait, `x.dtype` for a numpy array is a numpy dtype object, e.g. `np.int32`. `backend.is_float_dtype` expects a string or a backend dtype object. I need to check if `backend.is_float_dtype` can handle numpy dtypes. `backend.is_float_dtype` calls `standardize_dtype`. Let's look at `standardize_dtype` again in `keras/src/backend/common/variables.py`.\n\n```python\ndef standardize_dtype(dtype):\n    if dtype is None:\n        return config.floatx()\n    dtype = dtypes.PYTHON_DTYPES_MAP.get(dtype, dtype)\n    if hasattr(dtype, \"name\"):\n        dtype = dtype.name\n    ...\n    return dtype\n```\nA numpy dtype object has a `.name` attribute (e.g., `np.dtype('int32').name` is `'int32'`). So `standardize_dtype` should work correctly with numpy dtypes. And `is_float_dtype` will then correctly check if it starts with \"float\". This seems fine.\n\nSo, the change is to replace `return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)` with a conditional block.\n\nLet's apply the change using `sed`. The method `convert_input` is between lines 137 and 157 in `keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py`.\n\nThe line to change is `return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)` at line 156.\n\n```python\n137     def convert_input(self, x, autocast, dtype):\n138         dtype = backend.standardize_dtype(dtype)\n139         if backend.is_tensor(x):\n140             if (\n141                 autocast\n142                 and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n143                 and x.dtype != dtype\n144             ):\n145                 x = backend.cast(x, dtype=dtype)\n146             return x\n147         elif backend.is_keras_tensor(x):\n148             if (\n149                 autocast\n150                 and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n151                 and x.dtype != dtype\n152             ):\n153                 x.dtype = dtype\n154             return x\n155         elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n156             return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n157         return x\n```\n\nI will replace line 156.\nThe replacement should be:\n```python\n        # This path is for numpy array inputs.\n        # We only cast it to the policy's compute dtype if it's a float.\n        if (\n            autocast\n            and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n            and x.dtype != dtype\n        ):\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nThis is multiple lines, so a simple `sed -i` is tricky. I'll use `sed` to delete the line and then `cat` with a heredoc to insert the new code. Or, I can try to make a one-liner `sed` replacement.\n\nLet's try to write a `sed` command.\nI'll replace line 156 with the new block.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '156s|.*|        if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype:\\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)|' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis is getting complicated with newlines.\n\nA better approach is to use `sed` to delete the line and then use `sed` again to insert text after a certain line.\n`sed -i '156d' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py`\n`sed -i '155a ...' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py`\n\nLet's try to construct the `sed` insert command.\n```bash\nsed -i '155a \\\n        if (\\\n            autocast\\\n            and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\\\n            and x.dtype != dtype\\\n        ):\\\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\\\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis is also getting complex.\n\nLet's try another approach. I'll replace the line with a placeholder, then replace the placeholder with the multi-line content. No, that's also complex.\n\nLet's try to simplify the logic.\nThe original code is:\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nI want to change it to:\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            if not (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                dtype = None\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nThis is not quite right because `x.dtype` might not be defined for all things that have `__array__`. But for numpy arrays it is. And `dtype` is the policy's compute dtype, so setting it to `None` would mean we use the array's own dtype. This seems more compact.\n\nLet's check `x.dtype` for a list. `hasattr([], \"__array__\")` is false. So this branch is for numpy arrays.\n\nLet's try to write this logic.\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            original_dtype = getattr(x, \"dtype\", None)\n            if not (\n                autocast\n                and original_dtype is not None\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(original_dtype)\n                and original_dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                dtype = None\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nThis is getting complicated. The first idea was better.\n\nLet's go back to the first idea.\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            # This path is for numpy array inputs.\n            # We only cast it to the policy's compute dtype if it's a float.\n            if (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nThis is clean and correct. The only issue is applying it with `sed`.\n\nI can use `ed` or `ex` for this, but they are interactive. I can also use python to edit the file. But I am in a bash shell.\n\nLet's try `sed` with `c` command (change).\n```bash\nsed -i \"156c\\\\\n        if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype:\\\\\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\\\\\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n\" keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis might work. The indentation will be off.\n\nLet's check the indentation of line 156. It's 12 spaces.\n`            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)`\n\nMy replacement should be:\n```python\n            if (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nThe indentation is tricky.\n\nLet's try another way. I'll just change the one line.\nThe logic is: if it's a float, use `dtype`, otherwise use `None`.\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            cast_dtype = dtype if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) else None\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=cast_dtype)\n```\nThis is not quite right. If `x.dtype` is already `dtype`, we don't need to cast.\nThe condition is `autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype`.\n\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            should_cast = (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            )\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype if should_cast else None)\n```\nThis is a good one-liner (logically). But it spans multiple lines.\n\nLet's try to make it a real one-liner.\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype else None)\n```\nThis is a very long line, but it would work with `sed`.\nThe original line is `return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)`.\nI can replace `dtype=dtype` with `dtype=dtype if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype else None`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"s/ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)/ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype else None)/\" keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis seems too specific and might fail if there are other occurrences. I should use line number.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"156s/ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)/ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype else None)/\" keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis is still a bit risky due to the long line and potential formatting changes.\n\nLet's reconsider the multi-line replacement.\nI can use a here-document and `cat` to create a script that does the replacement, then execute it.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > replace.py\nimport fileinput\n\nfor line in fileinput.input('keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py', inplace=True):\n    if 'return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)' in line and fileinput.lineno() == 156:\n        print(\"\"\"        if (\n            autocast\n            and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n            and x.dtype != dtype\n        ):\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\"\"\")\n    else:\n        print(line, end='')\nEOF\npython replace.py\n```\nThis is too complex for the environment. I should stick to `sed`.\n\nLet's try to make the `sed` command more robust.\nThe line is `            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)`.\nI can replace the whole line.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '156s/.*/            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype else None)/' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis is still a very long line. Let's check python syntax for line breaks.\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            # This path is for numpy array inputs.\n            # We only cast it to the policy's compute dtype if it's a float.\n            if not (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                dtype = None\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nThis is a nice way to write it. It modifies `dtype` before calling `convert_to_tensor`.\nThis can be applied with `sed`. I need to insert lines before line 156.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '156i \\\n            if not (\\\n                autocast\\\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\\\n                and x.dtype != dtype\\\n            ):\\\n                dtype = None\n' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis is still complex with `\\`.\n\nLet's try another `sed` approach.\n```bash\nsed -i -e '156s/^/NEW_CODE\\n/' -e 's/NEW_CODE/replacement/' file\n```\nThis is also complex.\n\nLet's go back to the simplest idea. The problem is that `ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)` is called unconditionally for numpy arrays. I need to add a condition.\n\nThe structure is:\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nI will change it to:\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            if not backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype):\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nThis is simpler. But it doesn't consider `autocast` and `x.dtype != dtype`.\nThe logic in the `is_tensor` branch is: `autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype`. I should reuse it.\n\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            if (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nThis is the correct logic. Now to implement it with `sed`.\n\nI will use `ex` which is a non-interactive editor that can be scripted.\n```bash\nex -s -c '155d' -c '154a|        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            if (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)' -c 'wq' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis is getting too complex.\n\nLet's try a simple `sed` again.\nI'll replace line 155 and 156.\n```\n155         elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n156             return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nwith\n```\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            if (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nThis is a change from 2 lines to 7 lines.\n\nLet's try to find a simpler change.\nWhat if I change only line 156?\n```python\n155         elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n156             ... # new line(s) here\n```\nThe problem is that `dtype` is the policy's compute dtype. I want to pass `None` for integer arrays.\n\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            final_dtype = dtype\n            if not backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype):\n                final_dtype = None\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=final_dtype)\n```\nThis is simpler. It doesn't handle `autocast` or `x.dtype != dtype`.\n\nLet's stick to the correct logic.\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            if (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nI will use `sed` to delete lines 155 and 156, and then insert the new block.\n```bash\nsed -i '155,156d' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py && \\\nsed -i '154a \\        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\\n            if (\\n                autocast\\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\\n                and x.dtype != dtype\\n            ):\\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThe `\\n` in `sed` `a` command might not be portable.\n\nLet's try another way. I'll use a here-doc to create a patch file and apply it.\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > patch.diff\n--- a/keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n+++ b/keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n@@ -152,8 +152,14 @@\n             ):\n                 x.dtype = dtype\n             return x\n-        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n-            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n+        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n+            if (\n+                autocast\n+                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n+                and x.dtype != dtype\n+            ):\n+                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n+            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n         return x\n \n     def get_config(self):\n\nEOF\npatch -p1 < patch.diff\n```\nThis seems like a good, robust way to do it. I need to make sure the line numbers in my patch are correct.\nI saw lines 155-156. The context lines are 152-154 and 157.\n```python\n152             ):\n153                 x.dtype = dtype\n154             return x\n155         elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n156             return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n157         return x\n```\nThe patch seems correct.

The `old_code` is part of the file.\nThe `old_code` is lines 155 and 156.\nLet's check the file again.\n```python\n154             return x\n155         elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n156             return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n157         return x\n```\nThe `old_code` is `        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):` + `\\n` + `            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)`.\nThe python `\"\"\"...\"\"\"` string will capture this correctly.\n\nLet's try a simpler sed command that I think will work.\n```bash\nsed -i -e '155,156d' -e '154a\\\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\\\n            if (\\\n                autocast\\\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\\\n                and x.dtype != dtype\\\n            ):\\\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\\\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\\\n' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis is the standard way to do multiline insert with `sed`. It should be fine. It's less complex than creating a python script. I'll use this. I'll verify it after.\n\n```bash\nsed -i -e '155,156d' -e '154a\\\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\\\n            if (\\\n                autocast\\\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\\\n                and x.dtype != dtype\\\n            ):\\\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\\\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\\\n' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py && cat keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py | nl -ba | sed -n '150,165p'\n```\nThe `()` around the `if` condition are not necessary but don't hurt. I'll remove them to make it cleaner.\n\n```bash\nsed -i -e '155,156d' -e '154a\\\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\\\n            if (\\\n                autocast\\\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\\\n                and x.dtype != dtype\\\n            ):\\\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\\\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\\\n' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThe `()` are for grouping. Let's check python syntax.\n`if a and b and c:` is fine.\nThe original code had `if ( autocast ... )`. I'll keep it for consistency.\n\nFinal check of the `sed` command.\n1. `155,156d`: delete lines 155 and 156.\n2. `154a\\`: after line 154, append the following text.\n3. The text is escaped for the shell.\n\nThis seems correct. I will execute this.THOUGHT:\nThe user wants to fix an issue where `keras.autocast` incorrectly casts numpy integer types to float types when they are used as model inputs. This happens with policies like `mixed_float16`.\n\nMy analysis led me to `keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py`, specifically the `convert_input` method. I found that for inputs that are numpy arrays (which satisfy `hasattr(x, \"__array__\")`), the code unconditionally converts them to tensors with the policy's compute dtype. This is incorrect for integer arrays, which should not be cast to a float dtype.\n\nThe logic for tensor inputs already contains the correct checks: cast only if `autocast` is enabled, the input is a float type, and the dtype is different from the target dtype. I need to apply the same logic to numpy array inputs.\n\nThe relevant code snippet is:\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nI will replace this with a block that checks if the numpy array's dtype is a float type before attempting to cast it. If it's not a float type (e.g., it's an integer type), it should be converted to a tensor while preserving its original dtype.\n\nThe new logic will be:\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            if (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nThis logic ensures that only float-type numpy arrays are considered for casting, while integer-type arrays are converted to tensors with their dtype intact.\n\nTo apply this multi-line change, I will use `sed`. I'll first delete the original lines and then append the new code block at the correct position. The lines to be replaced are 155 and 156. I will insert the new code after line 154.\n\n```bash\nsed -i -e '155,156d' -e '154a\\\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\\\n            if (\\\n                autocast\\\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\\\n                and x.dtype != dtype\\\n            ):\\\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\\\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\\\n' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```",

                "content": "THOUGHT:The TensorFlow backend's `convert_to_tensor` uses `tf.convert_to_tensor`. The documentation for `tf.convert_to_tensor` states that if `dtype` is `None`, it infers the dtype from the input `value`. This is the behavior we want. When an integer numpy array is passed, it should create an integer tensor.\n\nSo, my proposed change to `keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py` is correct. I need to add a check for `is_float_dtype` before casting numpy arrays.\n\nThe current implementation is:\n```python\n    elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nThis unconditionally casts to `dtype`, which is the compute_dtype of the policy.\n\nI will change it to:\n```python\n    elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n        # This path is for numpy array inputs.\n        if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype:\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nHowever, `ops.convert_to_tensor(x)` will still convert it to a tensor. What if `x` is already a tensor? The first `if backend.is_tensor(x)` block should have handled it. `hasattr(x, \"__array__\")` is true for numpy arrays, and also for TensorFlow tensors. This could be a problem.\n\nLet's re-read `convert_input`.\n```python\ndef convert_input(self, x, autocast, dtype):\n    dtype = backend.standardize_dtype(dtype)\n    if backend.is_tensor(x):\n        if (\n            autocast\n            and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n            and x.dtype != dtype\n        ):\n            x = backend.cast(x, dtype=dtype)\n        return x\n    elif backend.is_keras_tensor(x):\n        ...\n        return x\n    elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n    return x\n```\n`backend.is_tensor(x)` for tensorflow backend checks `isinstance(x, (tf.Tensor, tf.Variable))`. `tf.Tensor` has an `__array__` method. So a `tf.Tensor` will enter the first `if` block and not the `elif`. So the `elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\")` is mainly for numpy arrays. This is good.\n\nSo, the change should be to add a condition.\nI will also need to import `backend` inside the method, or check if it's already available. It is available from the top of the file.\n\nThe logic should be:\n```python\n    elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n        # This path is for numpy array inputs.\n        # We only cast it to the policy's compute dtype if it's a float.\n        if (\n            autocast\n            and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n            and x.dtype != dtype\n        ):\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nThis seems a bit redundant with the first block. Let's look at the first block again.\n```python\n    if backend.is_tensor(x):\n        if (\n            autocast\n            and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n            and x.dtype != dtype\n        ):\n            x = backend.cast(x, dtype=dtype)\n        return x\n```\nThis block returns `x` if it's a tensor. If it's a tensor and needs casting, it's cast and returned. If not, it's returned as is.\n\nMy proposed change for `__array__` is:\n```python\n    elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n        if (\n            autocast\n            and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n            and x.dtype != dtype\n        ):\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nThis looks correct. It converts to tensor, but only casts to policy `dtype` if the original array is float. If it's an integer array, it will be converted to an integer tensor, preserving its dtype.\n\nBut wait, `x.dtype` for a numpy array is a numpy dtype object, e.g. `np.int32`. `backend.is_float_dtype` expects a string or a backend dtype object. I need to check if `backend.is_float_dtype` can handle numpy dtypes. `backend.is_float_dtype` calls `standardize_dtype`. Let's look at `standardize_dtype` again in `keras/src/backend/common/variables.py`.\n\n```python\ndef standardize_dtype(dtype):\n    if dtype is None:\n        return config.floatx()\n    dtype = dtypes.PYTHON_DTYPES_MAP.get(dtype, dtype)\n    if hasattr(dtype, \"name\"):\n        dtype = dtype.name\n    ...\n    return dtype\n```\nA numpy dtype object has a `.name` attribute (e.g., `np.dtype('int32').name` is `'int32'`). So `standardize_dtype` should work correctly with numpy dtypes. And `is_float_dtype` will then correctly check if it starts with \"float\". This seems fine.\n\nSo, the change is to replace `return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)` with a conditional block.\n\nLet's apply the change using `sed`. The method `convert_input` is between lines 137 and 157 in `keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py`.\n\nThe line to change is `return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)` at line 156.\n\n```python\n137     def convert_input(self, x, autocast, dtype):\n138         dtype = backend.standardize_dtype(dtype)\n139         if backend.is_tensor(x):\n140             if (\n141                 autocast\n142                 and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n143                 and x.dtype != dtype\n144             ):\n145                 x = backend.cast(x, dtype=dtype)\n146             return x\n147         elif backend.is_keras_tensor(x):\n148             if (\n149                 autocast\n150                 and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n151                 and x.dtype != dtype\n152             ):\n153                 x.dtype = dtype\n154             return x\n155         elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n156             return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n157         return x\n```\n\nI will replace line 156.\nThe replacement should be:\n```python\n        # This path is for numpy array inputs.\n        # We only cast it to the policy's compute dtype if it's a float.\n        if (\n            autocast\n            and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n            and x.dtype != dtype\n        ):\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nThis is multiple lines, so a simple `sed -i` is tricky. I'll use `sed` to delete the line and then `cat` with a heredoc to insert the new code. Or, I can try to make a one-liner `sed` replacement.\n\nLet's try to write a `sed` command.\nI'll replace line 156 with the new block.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '156s|.*|        if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype:\\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)|' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis is getting complicated with newlines.\n\nA better approach is to use `sed` to delete the line and then use `sed` again to insert text after a certain line.\n`sed -i '156d' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py`\n`sed -i '155a ...' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py`\n\nLet's try to construct the `sed` insert command.\n```bash\nsed -i '155a \\\n        if (\\\n            autocast\\\n            and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\\\n            and x.dtype != dtype\\\n        ):\\\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\\\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis is also getting complex.\n\nLet's try another approach. I'll replace the line with a placeholder, then replace the placeholder with the multi-line content. No, that's also complex.\n\nLet's try to simplify the logic.\nThe original code is:\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nI want to change it to:\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            if not (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                dtype = None\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nThis is not quite right because `x.dtype` might not be defined for all things that have `__array__`. But for numpy arrays it is. And `dtype` is the policy's compute dtype, so setting it to `None` would mean we use the array's own dtype. This seems more compact.\n\nLet's check `x.dtype` for a list. `hasattr([], \"__array__\")` is false. So this branch is for numpy arrays.\n\nLet's try to write this logic.\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            original_dtype = getattr(x, \"dtype\", None)\n            if not (\n                autocast\n                and original_dtype is not None\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(original_dtype)\n                and original_dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                dtype = None\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nThis is getting complicated. The first idea was better.\n\nLet's go back to the first idea.\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            # This path is for numpy array inputs.\n            # We only cast it to the policy's compute dtype if it's a float.\n            if (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nThis is clean and correct. The only issue is applying it with `sed`.\n\nI can use `ed` or `ex` for this, but they are interactive. I can also use python to edit the file. But I am in a bash shell.\n\nLet's try `sed` with `c` command (change).\n```bash\nsed -i \"156c\\\\\n        if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype:\\\\\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\\\\\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n\" keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis might work. The indentation will be off.\n\nLet's check the indentation of line 156. It's 12 spaces.\n`            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)`\n\nMy replacement should be:\n```python\n            if (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nThe indentation is tricky.\n\nLet's try another way. I'll just change the one line.\nThe logic is: if it's a float, use `dtype`, otherwise use `None`.\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            cast_dtype = dtype if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) else None\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=cast_dtype)\n```\nThis is not quite right. If `x.dtype` is already `dtype`, we don't need to cast.\nThe condition is `autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype`.\n\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            should_cast = (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            )\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype if should_cast else None)\n```\nThis is a good one-liner (logically). But it spans multiple lines.\n\nLet's try to make it a real one-liner.\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype else None)\n```\nThis is a very long line, but it would work with `sed`.\nThe original line is `return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)`.\nI can replace `dtype=dtype` with `dtype=dtype if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype else None`.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"s/ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)/ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype else None)/\" keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis seems too specific and might fail if there are other occurrences. I should use line number.\n\n```bash\nsed -i \"156s/ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)/ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype else None)/\" keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis is still a bit risky due to the long line and potential formatting changes.\n\nLet's reconsider the multi-line replacement.\nI can use a here-document and `cat` to create a script that does the replacement, then execute it.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > replace.py\nimport fileinput\n\nfor line in fileinput.input('keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py', inplace=True):\n    if 'return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)' in line and fileinput.lineno() == 156:\n        print(\"\"\"        if (\n            autocast\n            and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n            and x.dtype != dtype\n        ):\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n        return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\"\"\")\n    else:\n        print(line, end='')\nEOF\npython replace.py\n```\nThis is too complex for the environment. I should stick to `sed`.\n\nLet's try to make the `sed` command more robust.\nThe line is `            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)`.\nI can replace the whole line.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '156s/.*/            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype else None)/' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis is still a very long line. Let's check python syntax for line breaks.\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            # This path is for numpy array inputs.\n            # We only cast it to the policy's compute dtype if it's a float.\n            if not (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                dtype = None\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nThis is a nice way to write it. It modifies `dtype` before calling `convert_to_tensor`.\nThis can be applied with `sed`. I need to insert lines before line 156.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '156i \\\n            if not (\\\n                autocast\\\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\\\n                and x.dtype != dtype\\\n            ):\\\n                dtype = None\n' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis is still complex with `\\`.\n\nLet's try another `sed` approach.\n```bash\nsed -i -e '156s/^/NEW_CODE\\n/' -e 's/NEW_CODE/replacement/' file\n```\nThis is also complex.\n\nLet's go back to the simplest idea. The problem is that `ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)` is called unconditionally for numpy arrays. I need to add a condition.\n\nThe structure is:\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nI will change it to:\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            if not backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype):\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nThis is simpler. But it doesn't consider `autocast` and `x.dtype != dtype`.\nThe logic in the `is_tensor` branch is: `autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype`. I should reuse it.\n\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            if (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nThis is the correct logic. Now to implement it with `sed`.\n\nI will use `ex` which is a non-interactive editor that can be scripted.\n```bash\nex -s -c '155d' -c '154a|        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            if (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)' -c 'wq' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis is getting too complex.\n\nLet's try a simple `sed` again.\nI'll replace line 155 and 156.\n```\n155         elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n156             return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nwith\n```\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            if (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nThis is a change from 2 lines to 7 lines.\n\nLet's try to find a simpler change.\nWhat if I change only line 156?\n```python\n155         elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n156             ... # new line(s) here\n```\nThe problem is that `dtype` is the policy's compute dtype. I want to pass `None` for integer arrays.\n\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            final_dtype = dtype\n            if not backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype):\n                final_dtype = None\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=final_dtype)\n```\nThis is simpler. It doesn't handle `autocast` or `x.dtype != dtype`.\n\nLet's stick to the correct logic.\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            if (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nI will use `sed` to delete lines 155 and 156, and then insert the new block.\n```bash\nsed -i '155,156d' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py && \\\nsed -i '154a \\        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\\n            if (\\n                autocast\\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\\n                and x.dtype != dtype\\n            ):\\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThe `\\n` in `sed` `a` command might not be portable.\n\nLet's try another way. I'll use a here-doc to create a patch file and apply it.\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > patch.diff\n--- a/keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n+++ b/keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n@@ -152,8 +152,14 @@\n             ):\n                 x.dtype = dtype\n             return x\n-        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n-            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n+        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n+            if (\n+                autocast\n+                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n+                and x.dtype != dtype\n+            ):\n+                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n+            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n         return x\n \n     def get_config(self):\n\nEOF\npatch -p1 < patch.diff\n```\nThis seems like a good, robust way to do it. I need to make sure the line numbers in my patch are correct.\nI saw lines 155-156. The context lines are 152-154 and 157.\n```python\n152             ):\n153                 x.dtype = dtype\n154             return x\n155         elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n156             return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n157         return x\n```\nThe patch seems correct. The `--- a/` and `+++ b/` prefixes might need adjustment depending on the `patch` command's expectation of paths.

It's the most readable and correct.\nI will use `sed` to replace a single line with multiple lines. This is possible with `\\n` if using `bash` and `$'...'` or with `\\` at the end of each line.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '156s/.*/            if autocast and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype) and x.dtype != dtype:\\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)/' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis will have issues with indentation and `\\n`.\n\nLet's try `perl`.\n```bash\nperl -i -p0e 's/elif hasattr\\(x, \"__array__\"\\):\\n            return ops\\.convert_to_tensor\\(x, dtype=dtype\\)/elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\\n            if (\\n                autocast\\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\\n                and x.dtype != dtype\\n            ):\\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)/' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```\nThis is also getting very complex.\n\nI'll try to create a small python script to do the replacement.

Let's check python syntax.\n`if a and b and c:` is fine.\nThe original code had `if ( autocast ... )`. I'll keep it for consistency.\n\nFinal check of the `sed` command.\n1. `155,156d`: delete lines 155 and 156.\n2. `154a\\`: after line 154, append the following text.\n3. The text is escaped for the shell.\n\nThis seems correct. I will execute this.THOUGHT:\nThe user wants to fix an issue where `keras.autocast` incorrectly casts numpy integer types to float types when they are used as model inputs. This happens with policies like `mixed_float16`.\n\nMy analysis led me to `keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py`, specifically the `convert_input` method. I found that for inputs that are numpy arrays (which satisfy `hasattr(x, \"__array__\")`), the code unconditionally converts them to tensors with the policy's compute dtype. This is incorrect for integer arrays, which should not be cast to a float dtype.\n\nThe logic for tensor inputs already contains the correct checks: cast only if `autocast` is enabled, the input is a float type, and the dtype is different from the target dtype. I need to apply the same logic to numpy array inputs.\n\nThe relevant code snippet is:\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n```\nI will replace this with a block that checks if the numpy array's dtype is a float type before attempting to cast it. If it's not a float type (e.g., it's an integer type), it should be converted to a tensor while preserving its original dtype.\n\nThe new logic will be:\n```python\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\n            if (\n                autocast\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\n                and x.dtype != dtype\n            ):\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\n```\nThis logic ensures that only float-type numpy arrays are considered for casting, while integer-type arrays are converted to tensors with their dtype intact.\n\nTo apply this multi-line change, I will use `sed`. I'll first delete the original lines and then append the new code block at the correct position. The lines to be replaced are 155 and 156. I will insert the new code after line 154.\n\n```bash\nsed -i -e '155,156d' -e '154a\\\n        elif hasattr(x, \"__array__\"):\\\n            if (\\\n                autocast\\\n                and backend.is_float_dtype(x.dtype)\\\n                and x.dtype != dtype\\\n            ):\\\n                return ops.convert_to_tensor(x, dtype=dtype)\\\n            return ops.convert_to_tensor(x)\\\n' keras/src/dtype_policies/dtype_policy.py\n```",
