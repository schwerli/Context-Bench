Modify the signature of `load_balancing_loss_func` to accept `attention_mask`.\n2.  Inside the function, if `attention_mask` is provided, use it to mask the `gate_logits`.\n3.  The `gate_logits` is a tuple of tensors. Each tensor has shape `(batch_size * sequence_length, num_experts)`. The `attention_mask` has shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.\n4.  I need to find where `attention_mask` comes from. Looking at the `MixtralForCausalLM.forward` method, it receives `attention_mask`. I will need to pass it down to `load_balancing_loss_func`.\n5.  The `gate_logits` are collected from each `MixtralDecoderLayer`. The `attention_mask` is available in `MixtralModel.forward`. The `router_logits` are returned from `MixtralModel.forward` and then passed to `load_balancing_loss_func`.\n6.  The `gate_logits` are concatenated along `dim=0`. This means they are stacked. The shape becomes `(num_layers * batch_size * seq_len, num_experts)`.\n7.  The `attention_mask` is `(batch_size, seq_len)`. I need to repeat it for each layer. `attention_mask.repeat(num_layers, 1)`. Then I need to flatten it to `(num_layers * batch_size * seq_len)`.\n8.  I will use this mask to select the valid tokens from `concatenated_gate_logits`.\n\nLet's start by modifying `load_balancing_loss_func`.\n\nI will change the signature from:\n`def load_balancing_loss_func(gate_logits: torch.Tensor, num_experts: torch.Tensor = None, top_k=2) -> float:`\nto:\n`def load_balancing_loss_func(gate_logits: torch.Tensor, num_experts: int, top_k: int, attention_mask: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None) -> float:`\nI'll also update the docstring.\n\nThen, I'll add the logic to handle the mask.\nThe `gate_logits` is a tuple of tensors of shape `(batch_size * sequence_length, num_experts)`.\nLet's see where `gate_logits` comes from. It's `outputs.router_logits`.\n`MixtralModel.forward` returns `router_logits`.\nInside `MixtralModel.forward`, `router_logits` is a tuple of router logits from each decoder layer.\nInside `MixtralDecoderLayer.forward`, the `router_logits` are computed. The `hidden_states` have shape `(batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size)`. The `router_logits` are computed from this.\nThe `router_logits` from `MixtralSparseMoeBlock` has shape `(batch_size * seq_len, num_experts)`. This is correct.\n\nSo, in `load_balancing_loss_func`, `gate_logits` is a tuple of tensors.\nThe number of layers is `len(gate_logits)`.\nThe shape of one of these tensors is `(batch_size * seq_len, num_experts)`.\nThe `attention_mask` has shape `(batch_size, seq_len)`.\n\nThe logic should be:\nIf `attention_mask` is not `None`:\n1.  `num_layers = len(gate_logits)`\n2.  `batch_size, seq_len = attention_mask.shape`\n3.  Reshape `attention_mask` to `(batch_size * seq_len)`.\n4.  Find the indices of the non-padding tokens: `torch.where(attention_mask.view(-1) == 1)`.\n5.  For each `layer_gate` in `gate_logits`, select the rows corresponding to non-padding tokens.\n    But this is tricky because the `gate_logits` are concatenated.\n\nLet's rethink.\n`concatenated_gate_logits` has shape `(num_layers * batch_size * seq_len, num_experts)`.\nThe `attention_mask` is `(batch_size, seq_len)`.\nI can expand the `attention_mask`.\n`expanded_mask = attention_mask.repeat(len(gate_logits), 1).view(-1)`\nThis will have shape `(num_layers * batch_size * seq_len)`.\nThen I can select the logits where `expanded_mask == 1`.\n`concatenated_gate_logits = concatenated_gate_logits[expanded_mask.bool()]`\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nLet's apply this change with `sed`.\n\nFirst, change the function signature and docstring.\nThe original signature is on line 81.\n`def load_balancing_loss_func(gate_logits: torch.Tensor, num_experts: torch.Tensor = None, top_k=2) -> float:`\nI'll change it to:\n`def load_balancing_loss_func(gate_logits: torch.Tensor, num_experts: int, top_k: int, attention_mask: torch.Tensor = None) -> torch.Tensor:`\nThe return type is `torch.Tensor`, not `float`.\n\nThe docstring also needs updating.\nI'll add `attention_mask` to the `Args` section.\n\nLet's do it step-by-step.

      "content": "THOUGHT:\nNow that the signature and docstring are updated, I will modify the function body.\n\nHere's the original body:\n```python\n    if gate_logits is None or not isinstance(gate_logits, tuple):\n        return 0\n\n    if isinstance(gate_logits, tuple):\n        compute_device = gate_logits[0].device\n        concatenated_gate_logits = torch.cat([layer_gate.to(compute_device) for layer_gate in gate_logits], dim=0)\n\n    routing_weights = torch.nn.functional.softmax(concatenated_gate_logits, dim=-1)\n\n    _, selected_experts = torch.topk(routing_weights, top_k, dim=-1)\n\n    expert_mask = torch.nn.functional.one_hot(selected_experts, num_experts)\n\n    # Compute the percentage of tokens routed to each expert.\n    tokens_per_expert = torch.mean(expert_mask.float(), dim=0)\n\n    # Compute the average probability of routing to these experts.\n    router_prob_per_expert = torch.mean(routing_weights, dim=0)\n\n    overall_loss = torch.sum(tokens_per_expert * router_prob_per_expert.unsqueeze(0))\n    return overall_loss * num_experts\n```\n\nI need to add the logic for `attention_mask`.\nThe `gate_logits` are shaped `(batch_size * sequence_length, num_experts)`.\nThe `attention_mask` is `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.\n\nThe logic should be:\n```python\n    if gate_logits is None or not isinstance(gate_logits, tuple):\n        return 0\n\n    if isinstance(gate_logits, tuple):\n        compute_device = gate_logits[0].device\n        concatenated_gate_logits = torch.cat([layer_gate.to(compute_device) for layer_gate in gate_logits], dim=0)\n\n    # We only keep the tokens that are not padded\n    if attention_mask is not None:\n        # We repeat the attention mask on the num_layers dimension\n        attention_mask = attention_mask.repeat(len(gate_logits), 1)\n        concatenated_gate_logits = concatenated_gate_logits[attention_mask.flatten()]\n\n    routing_weights = torch.nn.functional.softmax(concatenated_gate_logits, dim=-1)\n    #... rest of the function\n```\nThe shape of `concatenated_gate_logits` is `(num_layers * batch_size * seq_len, num_experts)`.\nThe shape of `attention_mask` is `(batch_size, seq_len)`.\nAfter `repeat`, `attention_mask` is `(num_layers * batch_size, seq_len)`.\nAfter `flatten`, it is `(num_layers * batch_size * seq_len)`.\nThis seems correct. The selection `concatenated_gate_logits[attention_mask.flatten()]` will work if `attention_mask` is a boolean tensor. The `attention_mask` is usually 1s and 0s, so I should convert it to boolean.\n`concatenated_gate_logits = concatenated_gate_logits[attention_mask.flatten().bool()]`\nOr even better, since `attention_mask` is passed from `forward`, it might have a different shape. Let's check `_prepare_4d_causal_attention_mask`. It seems the mask is `(batch_size, 1, tgt_len, src_len)`. No, that's for attention. The `attention_mask` passed to `forward` is `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.\n\nThe `gate_logits` in the tuple are of shape `(batch_size * sequence_length, num_experts)`.\nSo `concatenated_gate_logits` is `(num_hidden_layers * batch_size * sequence_length, num_experts)`.\nThe `attention_mask` is `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.\nThe `repeat` logic is wrong. `attention_mask.repeat(len(gate_logits), 1)` will produce a tensor of shape `(num_layers * batch_size, sequence_length)`.\nI need to reshape it.\nLet's check the shapes.\n`gate_logits[0].shape` is `(B*S, E)`.\n`attention_mask.shape` is `(B, S)`.\n`concatenated_gate_logits.shape` is `(L*B*S, E)`.\n`attention_mask` needs to be reshaped to `(B*S,)` and then repeated `L` times.\n`attention_mask.view(-1)` gives `(B*S,)`.\n`attention_mask.view(-1).repeat(len(gate_logits))` gives `(L*B*S,)`.\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo the code should be:\n```python\n    # We only keep the tokens that are not padded\n    if attention_mask is not None:\n        attention_mask = attention_mask.view(-1).repeat(len(gate_logits))\n        concatenated_gate_logits = concatenated_gate_logits[attention_mask.bool()]\n```\nThis looks good. But what if `attention_mask` is not just 0s and 1s? The standard is that it is 1 for tokens to attend to, 0 for padding. So `bool()` should be fine.\n\nLet's check the rest of the function.\nThe original code returns `overall_loss * num_experts`. This is a float. My new signature says it returns a tensor. `torch.sum` returns a tensor of 0 dimensions. So that's fine.\nThe original code has `return 0`. I should change it to `return torch.tensor(0.0)`.\n\nThe logic seems to be:\n1. Concatenate gate logits.\n2. If attention mask is present, filter the concatenated logits.\n3. Compute routing weights, selected experts, expert mask.\n4. Compute `tokens_per_expert` and `router_prob_per_expert`.\n5. Compute `overall_loss`.\n6. Return loss.\n\nThe filtering logic seems to be what's requested.\n\nLet's check the original implementation again.\n```python\ndef load_balancing_loss_func(gate_logits: torch.Tensor, num_experts: torch.Tensor = None, top_k=2) -> float:\n    # ...\n    if gate_logits is None or not isinstance(gate_logits, tuple):\n        return 0\n\n    if isinstance(gate_logits, tuple):\n        compute_device = gate_logits[0].device\n        concatenated_gate_logits = torch.cat([layer_gate.to(compute_device) for layer_gate in gate_logits], dim=0)\n\n    routing_weights = torch.nn.functional.softmax(concatenated_gate_logits, dim=-1)\n    # ...\n```\nThe `isinstance` check is weird. It should just be `if isinstance...`. The `if gate_logits is None` part is good.\n\nI'll replace the whole function body.\n\nNew function body:\n```python\n    if gate_logits is None or not isinstance(gate_logits, tuple):\n        return torch.tensor(0.0, device=self.device) # Should be device of the model. But this function is global.\n\n    if isinstance(gate_logits, tuple):\n        compute_device = gate_logits[0].device\n        concatenated_gate_logits = torch.cat([layer_gate.to(compute_device) for layer_gate in gate_logits], dim=0)\n\n    if attention_mask is not None:\n        attention_mask = attention_mask.view(-1).repeat(len(gate_logits))\n        concatenated_gate_logits = concatenated_gate_logits[attention_mask.bool()]\n\n    routing_weights = torch.nn.functional.softmax(concatenated_gate_logits, dim=-1)\n\n    _, selected_experts = torch.topk(routing_weights, top_k, dim=-1)\n\n    expert_mask = torch.nn.functional.one_hot(selected_experts, num_experts)\n\n    # Compute the percentage of tokens routed to each expert.\n    tokens_per_expert = torch.mean(expert_mask.float(), dim=0)\n\n    # Compute the average probability of routing to these experts.\n    router_prob_per_expert = torch.mean(routing_weights, dim=0)\n\n    overall_loss = torch.sum(tokens_per_expert * router_prob_per_expert.unsqueeze(0))\n    return overall_loss * num_experts\n```\nThe `return 0` should be `torch.tensor(0.0)`. And it needs a device. The `gate_logits` might be empty.\nIf `gate_logits` is `None`, I don't have a device.\nThe call site in `MixtralForCausalLM` is:\n```python\n            aux_loss = load_balancing_loss_func(\n                outputs.router_logits if return_dict else outputs[-1], self.num_experts, self.num_experts_per_tok\n            )\n```\nI need to pass `attention_mask` here.\n```python\n            aux_loss = load_balancing_loss_func(\n                outputs.router_logits if return_dict else outputs[-1],\n                self.num_experts,\n                self.num_experts_per_tok,\n                attention_mask=attention_mask,\n            )\n```\nThe `attention_mask` is available in `MixtralForCausalLM.forward`.\nThe `forward` signature is `def forward(self, input_ids: torch.LongTensor = None, attention_mask: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None, ...`.\nSo `attention_mask` is available.\n\nNow, back to `load_balancing_loss_func`.\nIf `gate_logits` is `None`, what should be the device of the returned tensor?\nThe call site is inside `MixtralForCausalLM`. I can probably get the device from `self.device`. But `load_balancing_loss_func` is a standalone function.\nIf `gate_logits` is not `None`, then `gate_logits[0].device` can be used.\nIf `gate_logits` is `None`, then `aux_loss` will be `0`. If `labels` is not `None`, then `loss += self.router_aux_loss_coef * aux_loss`. This will work with a python `0`.\nThe original code returns `0`. Let's stick to that if possible.\nThe problem is that if `attention_mask` filters everything, `concatenated_gate_logits` could become empty.\nIf `concatenated_gate_logits` is empty, `routing_weights` will be empty. `torch.mean` on an empty tensor returns `nan`. This will propagate.\nI should add a check: `if concatenated_gate_logits.shape[0] == 0: return torch.tensor(0.0, device=concatenated_gate_logits.device)`.\n\nThe logic for `attention_mask` seems wrong.\n`attention_mask` is `(batch_size, seq_len)`.\n`gate_logits` is a tuple of `L` tensors of shape `(B*S, E)`.\n`concatenated_gate_logits` is `(L*B*S, E)`.\n`attention_mask.view(-1)` is `(B*S)`.\n`attention_mask.view(-1).repeat(len(gate_logits))` is `(L*B*S)`.\nThis seems correct.\n\nLet's check the `MixtralForCausalLM.forward` method to see where to pass the `attention_mask`.\nI'll use `grep` to find the call.\n\n```bash\ngrep -n \"load_balancing_loss_func\" src/transformers/models/mixtral/modeling_mixtral.py\n```",

                "content": "THOUGHT:\nNow that the signature and docstring are updated, I will modify the function body.\n\nHere's the original body:\n```python\n    if gate_logits is None or not isinstance(gate_logits, tuple):\n        return 0\n\n    if isinstance(gate_logits, tuple):\n        compute_device = gate_logits[0].device\n        concatenated_gate_logits = torch.cat([layer_gate.to(compute_device) for layer_gate in gate_logits], dim=0)\n\n    routing_weights = torch.nn.functional.softmax(concatenated_gate_logits, dim=-1)\n\n    _, selected_experts = torch.topk(routing_weights, top_k, dim=-1)\n\n    expert_mask = torch.nn.functional.one_hot(selected_experts, num_experts)\n\n    # Compute the percentage of tokens routed to each expert.\n    tokens_per_expert = torch.mean(expert_mask.float(), dim=0)\n\n    # Compute the average probability of routing to these experts.\n    router_prob_per_expert = torch.mean(routing_weights, dim=0)\n\n    overall_loss = torch.sum(tokens_per_expert * router_prob_per_expert.unsqueeze(0))\n    return overall_loss * num_experts\n```\n\nI need to add the logic for `attention_mask`.\nThe `gate_logits` are shaped `(batch_size * sequence_length, num_experts)`.\nThe `attention_mask` is `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.\n\nThe logic should be:\n```python\n    if gate_logits is None or not isinstance(gate_logits, tuple):\n        return 0\n\n    if isinstance(gate_logits, tuple):\n        compute_device = gate_logits[0].device\n        concatenated_gate_logits = torch.cat([layer_gate.to(compute_device) for layer_gate in gate_logits], dim=0)\n\n    # We only keep the tokens that are not padded\n    if attention_mask is not None:\n        # We repeat the attention mask on the num_layers dimension\n        attention_mask = attention_mask.repeat(len(gate_logits), 1)\n        concatenated_gate_logits = concatenated_gate_logits[attention_mask.flatten()]\n\n    routing_weights = torch.nn.functional.softmax(concatenated_gate_logits, dim=-1)\n    #... rest of the function\n```\nThe shape of `concatenated_gate_logits` is `(num_layers * batch_size * seq_len, num_experts)`.\nThe shape of `attention_mask` is `(batch_size, seq_len)`.\nAfter `repeat`, `attention_mask` is `(num_layers * batch_size, seq_len)`.\nAfter `flatten`, it is `(num_layers * batch_size * seq_len)`.\nThis seems correct. The selection `concatenated_gate_logits[attention_mask.flatten()]` will work if `attention_mask` is a boolean tensor. The `attention_mask` is usually 1s and 0s, so I should convert it to boolean.\n`concatenated_gate_logits = concatenated_gate_logits[attention_mask.flatten().bool()]`\nOr even better, since `attention_mask` is passed from `forward`, it might have a different shape. Let's check `_prepare_4d_causal_attention_mask`. It seems the mask is `(batch_size, 1, tgt_len, src_len)`. No, that's for attention. The `attention_mask` passed to `forward` is `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.\n\nThe `gate_logits` in the tuple are of shape `(batch_size * sequence_length, num_experts)`.\nSo `concatenated_gate_logits` is `(num_hidden_layers * batch_size * sequence_length, num_experts)`.\nThe `attention_mask` is `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.\nThe `repeat` logic is wrong. `attention_mask.repeat(len(gate_logits), 1)` will produce a tensor of shape `(num_layers * batch_size, sequence_length)`.\nI need to reshape it.\nLet's check the shapes.\n`gate_logits[0].shape` is `(B*S, E)`.\n`attention_mask.shape` is `(B, S)`.\n`concatenated_gate_logits.shape` is `(L*B*S, E)`.\n`attention_mask` needs to be reshaped to `(B*S,)` and then repeated `L` times.\n`attention_mask.view(-1)` gives `(B*S,)`.\n`attention_mask.view(-1).repeat(len(gate_logits))` gives `(L*B*S,)`.\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo the code should be:\n```python\n    # We only keep the tokens that are not padded\n    if attention_mask is not None:\n        attention_mask = attention_mask.view(-1).repeat(len(gate_logits))\n        concatenated_gate_logits = concatenated_gate_logits[attention_mask.bool()]\n```\nThis looks good. But what if `attention_mask` is not just 0s and 1s? The standard is that it is 1 for tokens to attend to, 0 for padding. So `bool()` should be fine.\n\nLet's check the rest of the function.\nThe original code returns `overall_loss * num_experts`. This is a float. My new signature says it returns a tensor. `torch.sum` returns a tensor of 0 dimensions. So that's fine.\nThe original code has `return 0`. I should change it to `return torch.tensor(0.0)`.\n\nThe logic seems to be:\n1. Concatenate gate logits.\n2. If attention mask is present, filter the concatenated logits.\n3. Compute routing weights, selected experts, expert mask.\n4. Compute `tokens_per_expert` and `router_prob_per_expert`.\n5. Compute `overall_loss`.\n6. Return loss.\n\nThe filtering logic seems to be what's requested.\n\nLet's check the original implementation again.\n```python\ndef load_balancing_loss_func(gate_logits: torch.Tensor, num_experts: torch.Tensor = None, top_k=2) -> float:\n    # ...\n    if gate_logits is None or not isinstance(gate_logits, tuple):\n        return 0\n\n    if isinstance(gate_logits, tuple):\n        compute_device = gate_logits[0].device\n        concatenated_gate_logits = torch.cat([layer_gate.to(compute_device) for layer_gate in gate_logits], dim=0)\n\n    routing_weights = torch.nn.functional.softmax(concatenated_gate_logits, dim=-1)\n    # ...\n```\nThe `isinstance` check is weird. It should just be `if isinstance...`. The `if gate_logits is None` part is good.\n\nI'll replace the whole function body.\n\nNew function body:\n```python\n    if gate_logits is None or not isinstance(gate_logits, tuple):\n        return torch.tensor(0.0, device=self.device) # Should be device of the model. But this function is global.\n\n    if isinstance(gate_logits, tuple):\n        compute_device = gate_logits[0].device\n        concatenated_gate_logits = torch.cat([layer_gate.to(compute_device) for layer_gate in gate_logits], dim=0)\n\n    if attention_mask is not None:\n        attention_mask = attention_mask.view(-1).repeat(len(gate_logits))\n        concatenated_gate_logits = concatenated_gate_logits[attention_mask.bool()]\n\n    routing_weights = torch.nn.functional.softmax(concatenated_gate_logits, dim=-1)\n\n    _, selected_experts = torch.topk(routing_weights, top_k, dim=-1)\n\n    expert_mask = torch.nn.functional.one_hot(selected_experts, num_experts)\n\n    # Compute the percentage of tokens routed to each expert.\n    tokens_per_expert = torch.mean(expert_mask.float(), dim=0)\n\n    # Compute the average probability of routing to these experts.\n    router_prob_per_expert = torch.mean(routing_weights, dim=0)\n\n    overall_loss = torch.sum(tokens_per_expert * router_prob_per_expert.unsqueeze(0))\n    return overall_loss * num_experts\n```\nThe `return 0` should be `torch.tensor(0.0)`. And it needs a device. The `gate_logits` might be empty.\nIf `gate_logits` is `None`, I don't have a device.\nThe call site in `MixtralForCausalLM` is:\n```python\n            aux_loss = load_balancing_loss_func(\n                outputs.router_logits if return_dict else outputs[-1], self.num_experts, self.num_experts_per_tok\n            )\n```\nI need to pass `attention_mask` here.\n```python\n            aux_loss = load_balancing_loss_func(\n                outputs.router_logits if return_dict else outputs[-1],\n                self.num_experts,\n                self.num_experts_per_tok,\n                attention_mask=attention_mask,\n            )\n```\nThe `attention_mask` is available in `MixtralForCausalLM.forward`.\nThe `forward` signature is `def forward(self, input_ids: torch.LongTensor = None, attention_mask: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None, ...`.\nSo `attention_mask` is available.\n\nNow, back to `load_balancing_loss_func`.\nIf `gate_logits` is `None`, what should be the device of the returned tensor?\nThe call site is inside `MixtralForCausalLM`. I can probably get the device from `self.device`. But `load_balancing_loss_func` is a standalone function.\nIf `gate_logits` is not `None`, then `gate_logits[0].device` can be used.\nIf `gate_logits` is `None`, then `aux_loss` will be `0`. If `labels` is not `None`, then `loss += self.router_aux_loss_coef * aux_loss`. This will work with a python `0`.\nThe original code returns `0`. Let's stick to that if possible.\nThe problem is that if `attention_mask` filters everything, `concatenated_gate_logits` could become empty.\nIf `concatenated_gate_logits` is empty, `routing_weights` will be empty. `torch.mean` on an empty tensor returns `nan`. This will propagate.\nI should add a check: `if concatenated_gate_logits.shape[0] == 0: return torch.tensor(0.0, device=concatenated_gate_logits.device)`.\n\nThe logic for `attention_mask` seems wrong.\n`attention_mask` is `(batch_size, seq_len)`.\n`gate_logits` is a tuple of `L` tensors of shape `(B*S, E)`.\n`concatenated_gate_logits` is `(L*B*S, E)`.\n`attention_mask.view(-1)` is `(B*S)`.\n`attention_mask.view(-1).repeat(len(gate_logits))` is `(L*B*S)`.\nThis seems correct.\n\nLet's check the `MixtralForCausalLM.forward` method to see where to pass the `attention_mask`.\nI'll use `grep` to find the call.\n\n```bash\ngrep -n \"load_balancing_loss_func\" src/transformers/models/mixtral/modeling_mixtral.py\n```",
