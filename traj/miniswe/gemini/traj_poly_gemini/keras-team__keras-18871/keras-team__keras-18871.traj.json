                "content": "THOUGHT\nThe implementation of `keras.saving.saving_api.save_model` is indeed very similar to `keras.models.model.Model.save`. The logic for handling `save_format`, checking for file existence, and delegating to `saving_lib.save_model` or `legacy_h5_format.save_model_to_hdf5` is present in both.\n\nThe goal is to refactor `Model.save` to just call `keras.saving.save_model`.\n\nLooking at `keras/models/model.py`, I can see `saving_lib` is imported as `from keras.saving import saving_lib`.\nIn `keras/saving/saving_api.py`, `saving_lib` is also imported.\n\nThe refactoring should be straightforward. I need to modify `keras/models/model.py`.\nThe `save` method in `Model` should be changed to:\n\n```python\ndef save(self, filepath, overwrite=True, **kwargs):\n    # Docstring can be kept, but implementation should be a single line.\n    # Or maybe the docstring should be shortened.\n    # The PR description says \"model.save() method can be removed and be modified to just calling keras.saving.save_model()\".\n    # Let's check the imports in model.py\n    # It has `from keras.saving import saving_lib`.\n    # It does not import `save_model` from `saving_api`.\n    # I'll need to add an import.\n    from keras.saving import saving_api\n    saving_api.save_model(self, filepath, overwrite=overwrite, **kwargs)\n```\n\nLet's check the imports in `keras/models/model.py`.\n\n```bash\nhead -n 30 keras/models/model.py\n```",

                "content": "THOUGHT\nThe change has been applied correctly. The `save` method in `keras/models/model.py` now has its original docstring and a one-line implementation that calls `saving_api.save_model`. This fulfills the requirement of the PR.\n\nThe PR description also mentions that `model.save()` and `keras.saving.save_model()` have almost the same code and this causes version fragmentation. By making `model.save()` call `keras.saving.save_model()`, I have removed the code duplication.\n\nThe PR description also mentions \"I think `model.save()` method can be removed and be modified to just calling `keras.saving.save_model()`.\" I have modified it to call `keras.saving.save_model()`. Removing it would be a breaking change, so modifying it is the correct approach.\n\nThe change is in a non-test file as requested. I believe the task is complete. I will now submit the final output.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && (git status >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (cd */. 2>/dev/null && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (echo \"Error: No git repository found\")\n```",
