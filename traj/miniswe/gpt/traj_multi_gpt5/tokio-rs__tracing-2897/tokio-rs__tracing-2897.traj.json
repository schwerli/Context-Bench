Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in the current working directory (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.ext\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.ext | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.ext\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.ext\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.ext | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.ext | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Multi-SWE-bench Specific Notes\n- You are working in a Multi-SWE-bench environment with multi-language repositories\n- The project may be in a subdirectory (e.g., /home/repo-name/)\n- Git repository is typically located in the project subdirectory\n- When working with Git operations, ensure you're in the correct repository directory\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.ext | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && (git status >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (cd */. 2>/dev/null && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (find . -name '.git' -type d -exec sh -c 'cd \"$(dirname \"{}\")\" && git add -A && git diff --cached' \\; 2>/dev/null | head -n 1000) || (echo \"Error: No git repository found\")\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

A procedural macro attribute for instrumenting functions with [`tracing`].\n     2\t//!\n     3\t//! [`tracing`] is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect\n     4\t//! structured, event-based diagnostic information. This crate provides the\n     5\t//! [`#[instrument]`][instrument] procedural macro attribute.\n     6\t//!\n     7\t//! Note that this macro is also re-exported by the main `tracing` crate.\n     8\t//!\n     9\t//! *Compiler support: [requires `rustc` 1.63+][msrv]*\n    10\t//!\n    11\t//! [msrv]: #supported-rust-versions\n    12\t//!\n    13\t//! ## Usage\n    14\t//!\n    15\t//! In the `Cargo.toml`:\n    16\t//!\n    17\t//! ```toml\n    18\t//! [dependencies]\n    19\t//! tracing = \"0.1\"\n    20\t//! ```\n    21\t//!\n    22\t//! The [`#[instrument]`][instrument] attribute can now be added to a function\n    23\t//! to automatically create and enter `tracing` [span] when that function is\n    24\t//! called. For example:\n    25\t//!\n    26\t//! ```\n    27\t//! use tracing::instrument;\n    28\t//!\n    29\t//! #[instrument]\n    30\t//! pub fn my_function(my_arg: usize) {\n    31\t//!     // ...\n    32\t//! }\n    33\t//!\n    34\t//! # fn main() {}\n    35\t//! ```\n    36\t//!\n    37\t//! [`tracing`]: https://crates.io/crates/tracing\n    38\t//! [instrument]: macro@instrument\n    39\t//! [span]: https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/span/index.html\n    40\t//!\n    41\t//! ## Supported Rust Versions\n    42\t//!\n    43\t//! Tracing is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported\n    44\t//! version is 1.63. The current Tracing version is not guaranteed to build on\n    45\t//! Rust versions earlier than the minimum supported version.\n    46\t//!\n    47\t//! Tracing follows the same compiler support policies as the rest of the Tokio\n    48\t//! project. The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor\n    49\t//! versions before it will always be supported. For example, if the current\n    50\t//! stable compiler version is 1.69, the minimum supported version will not be\n    51\t//! increased past 1.66, three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum\n    52\t//! supported compiler version is not considered a semver breaking change as\n    53\t//! long as doing so complies with this policy.\n    54\t//!\n    55\t#![doc(\n    56\t    html_logo_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tokio-rs/tracing/master/assets/logo-type.png\",\n    57\t    html_favicon_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tokio-rs/tracing/master/assets/favicon.ico\",\n    58\t    issue_tracker_base_url = \"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/\"\n    59\t)]\n    60\t#![warn(\n    61\t    missing_debug_implementations,\n    62\t    missing_docs,\n    63\t    rust_2018_idioms,\n    64\t    unreachable_pub,\n    65\t    bad_style,\n    66\t    dead_code,\n    67\t    improper_ctypes,\n    68\t    non_shorthand_field_patterns,\n    69\t    no_mangle_generic_items,\n    70\t    overflowing_literals,\n    71\t    path_statements,\n    72\t    patterns_in_fns_without_body,\n    73\t    private_interfaces,\n    74\t    private_bounds,\n    75\t    unconditional_recursion,\n    76\t    unused_allocation,\n    77\t    unused_comparisons,\n    78\t    unused_parens,\n    79\t    while_true\n    80\t)]\n    81\t\n    82\tuse proc_macro2::TokenStream;\n    83\tuse quote::{quote, ToTokens};\n    84\tuse syn::parse::{Parse, ParseStream};\n    85\tuse syn::{Attribute, ItemFn, Signature, Visibility};\n    86\t\n    87\tmod attr;\n    88\tmod expand;\n    89\t/// Instruments a function to create and enter a `tracing` [span] every time\n    90\t/// the function is called.\n    91\t///\n    92\t/// Unless overridden, a span with `info` level will be generated.\n    93\t/// The generated span's name will be the name of the function.\n    94\t/// By default, all arguments to the function are included as fields on the\n    95\t/// span.
