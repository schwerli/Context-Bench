Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in the current working directory (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2.

Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.ext\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.ext | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.ext\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.ext\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.ext | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.ext | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Multi-SWE-bench Specific Notes\n- You are working in a Multi-SWE-bench environment with multi-language repositories\n- The project may be in a subdirectory (e.g., /home/repo-name/)\n- Git repository is typically located in the project subdirectory\n- When working with Git operations, ensure you're in the correct repository directory\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.ext | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && (git status >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (cd */. 2>/dev/null && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (find . -name '.git' -type d -exec sh -c 'cd \"$(dirname \"{}\")\" && git add -A && git diff --cached' \\; 2>/dev/null | head -n 1000) || (echo \"Error: No git repository found\")\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

This isn't *just* a simple cherry-pick\r\nbecause the new tests in that branch use the v0.2.x module names, so\r\nthat had to be fixed. Otherwise, though, it's the same change, and I'll go\r\nahead and merge it when CI passes, since it was approved on `master`.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, using `#[instrument(err)]` on a function returning a `Result`\r\nwith an `impl Trait` in it results in a compiler error. This is because\r\nwe generate a type annotation on the closure in the function body that\r\ncontains the user function's actual body, and `impl Trait` isn't allowed\r\non types in local bindings, only on function parameters and return\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis branch fixes the issue by simply removing the return type\r\nannotation from the closure. I've also added tests that break on master\r\nfor functions returning `impl Trait`, both with and without the `err`\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nFixes #1227\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Eliza Weisman <eliza@buoyant.io>\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.

A procedural macro attribute for instrumenting functions with [`tracing`].\n     2\t//!\n     3\t//! [`tracing`] is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect\n     4\t//! structured, event-based diagnostic information. This crate provides the\n     5\t//! [`#[instrument]`][instrument] procedural macro attribute.\n     6\t//!\n     7\t//! Note that this macro is also re-exported by the main `tracing` crate.\n     8\t//!\n     9\t//! *Compiler support: [requires `rustc` 1.42+][msrv]*\n    10\t//!\n    11\t//! [msrv]: #supported-rust-versions\n    12\t//!\n    13\t//! ## Usage\n    14\t//!\n    15\t//! First, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:\n    16\t//!\n    17\t//! ```toml\n    18\t//! [dependencies]\n    19\t//! tracing-attributes = \"0.1.12\"\n    20\t//! ```\n    21\t//!\n    22\t//! The [`#[instrument]`][instrument] attribute can now be added to a function\n    23\t//! to automatically create and enter `tracing` [span] when that function is\n    24\t//! called. For example:\n    25\t//!\n    26\t//! ```\n    27\t//! use tracing_attributes::instrument;\n    28\t//!\n    29\t//! #[instrument]\n    30\t//! pub fn my_function(my_arg: usize) {\n    31\t//!     // ...\n    32\t//! }\n    33\t//!\n    34\t//! # fn main() {}\n    35\t//! ```\n    36\t//!\n    37\t//! [`tracing`]: https://crates.io/crates/tracing\n    38\t//! [span]: https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/span/index.html\n    39\t//! [instrument]: attr.instrument.html\n    40\t//!\n    41\t//! ## Supported Rust Versions\n    42\t//!\n    43\t//! Tracing is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported\n    44\t//! version is 1.42. The current Tracing version is not guaranteed to build on\n    45\t//! Rust versions earlier than the minimum supported version.\n    46\t//!\n    47\t//! Tracing follows the same compiler support policies as the rest of the Tokio\n    48\t//! project. The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor\n    49\t//! versions before it will always be supported. For example, if the current\n    50\t//! stable compiler version is 1.45, the minimum supported version will not be\n    51\t//! increased past 1.42, three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum\n    52\t//! supported compiler version is not considered a semver breaking change as\n    53\t//! long as doing so complies with this policy.\n    54\t//!\n    55\t#![doc(html_root_url = \"https://docs.rs/tracing-attributes/0.1.12\")]\n    56\t#![doc(\n    57\t    html_logo_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tokio-rs/tracing/master/assets/logo-type.png\",\n    58\t    issue_tracker_base_url = \"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/\"\n    59\t)]\n    60\t#![cfg_attr(docsrs, deny(broken_intra_doc_links))]\n    61\t#![warn(\n    62\t    missing_debug_implementations,\n    63\t    missing_docs,\n    64\t    rust_2018_idioms,\n    65\t    unreachable_pub,\n    66\t    bad_style,\n    67\t    const_err,\n    68\t    dead_code,\n    69\t    improper_ctypes,\n    70\t    non_shorthand_field_patterns,\n    71\t    no_mangle_generic_items,\n    72\t    overflowing_literals,\n    73\t    path_statements,\n    74\t    patterns_in_fns_without_body,\n    75\t    private_in_public,\n    76\t    unconditional_recursion,\n    77\t    unused,\n    78\t    unused_allocation,\n    79\t    unused_comparisons,\n    80\t    unused_parens,\n    81\t    while_true\n    82\t)]\n    83\t// TODO: once `tracing` bumps its MSRV to 1.42, remove this allow.\n    84\t#![allow(unused)]\n    85\textern crate proc_macro;\n    86\t\n    87\tuse std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet};\n    88\tuse std::iter;\n    89\t\n    90\tuse proc_macro2::TokenStream;\n    91\tuse quote::{quote, quote_spanned, ToTokens, TokenStreamExt as _};\n    92\tuse syn::ext::IdentExt as _;\n    93\tuse syn::parse::{Parse, ParseStream};\n    94\tuse syn::{\n    95\t    punctuated::Punctuated, spanned::Spanned, AttributeArgs, Block, Expr, ExprCall, FieldPat,\n    96\t    FnArg, Ident, Item, ItemFn, Lit, LitInt, LitStr, Meta, MetaList, MetaNameValue, NestedMeta,\n    97\t    Pat, PatIdent, PatReference, PatStruct, PatTuple, PatTupleStruct, PatType, Path, Signature,\n    98\t    Stmt, Token,\n    99\t};\n   100\t/// Instruments a function to create and enter a `tracing` [span] every time\n   101\t/// the function is called.\n   102\t///\n   103\t/// By default, the generated span's [name] will be the name of the function,\n   104\t/// the span's [target] will be the current module path, and the span's [level]\n   105\t/// will be [`INFO`], although these properties can be overridden.

The [module path] is still recorded separately.

Level names are not case sensitive. For example:\n   144\t///\n   145\t/// ```\n   146\t/// # use tracing_attributes::instrument;\n   147\t/// // The span's level will be TRACE rather than INFO.\n   148\t/// #[instrument(level = \"trace\")]\n   149\t/// pub fn my_function() {\n   150\t///     // ...

This can be used when an argument to an instrumented function does\n   160\t/// not implement [`fmt::Debug`], or to exclude an argument with a verbose or\n   161\t/// costly `Debug` implementation. Note that:\n   162\t///\n   163\t/// - multiple argument names can be passed to `skip`.\n   164\t/// - arguments passed to `skip` do _not_ need to implement `fmt::Debug`.\n   165\t///\n   166\t/// ## Examples\n   167\t///\n   168\t/// ```\n   169\t/// # use tracing_attributes::instrument;\n   170\t/// // This type doesn't implement `fmt::Debug`!\n   171\t/// struct NonDebug;\n   172\t///\n   173\t/// // `arg` will be recorded, while `non_debug` will not.\n   174\t/// #[instrument(skip(non_debug))]\n   175\t/// fn my_function(arg: usize, non_debug: NonDebug) {\n   176\t///     // ...\n   177\t/// }\n   178\t/// ```\n   179\t///\n   180\t/// Skipping the `self` parameter:\n   181\t///\n   182\t/// ```\n   183\t/// # use tracing_attributes::instrument;\n   184\t/// #[derive(Debug)]\n   185\t/// struct MyType {\n   186\t///    data: Vec<u8>, // Suppose this buffer is often quite long...\n   187\t/// }\n   188\t///\n   189\t/// impl MyType {\n   190\t///     // Suppose we don't want to print an entire kilobyte of `data`\n   191\t///     // every time this is called...\n   192\t///     #[instrument(skip(self))]\n   193\t///     pub fn my_method(&mut self, an_interesting_argument: usize) {\n   194\t///          // ... do something (hopefully, using all that `data`!)\n   195\t///     }\n   196\t/// }\n   197\t/// ```\n   198\t///\n   199\t/// # Adding Fields\n   200\t///\n</output>",
