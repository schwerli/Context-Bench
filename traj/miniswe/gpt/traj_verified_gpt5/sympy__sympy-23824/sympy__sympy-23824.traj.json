      "content": "<pr_description>\nConsider the following PR description:\nphysics.hep.kahane_simplify() incorrectly reverses order of leading uncontracted gamma matrices\nThe kahane_simplify() function applies [identities](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gamma_matrices&oldid=1098219980#Miscellaneous_identities) such as $\\gamma^\\mu \\gamma_\\mu = 4 I_4$ to simplify products of gamma matrices in which contracted matrices occur. Leading gamma matrices without contractions should be unaffected, but a bug causes such leading terms to be prepended in reverse order.\r\n\r\nThe bug is illustrated by the following example:\r\n```python\r\nimport sympy\r\nfrom sympy.physics.hep.gamma_matrices import GammaMatrix as G, gamma_trace, LorentzIndex\r\nfrom sympy.physics.hep.gamma_matrices import kahane_simplify\r\nfrom sympy.tensor.tensor import tensor_indices\r\n\r\ndef test_kahane_leading_gamma_matrix_bug():\r\n    mu, nu, rho, sigma = tensor_indices(\"mu, nu, rho, sigma\", LorentzIndex)\r\n    \r\n    t = G(mu)*G(-mu)*G(rho)*G(sigma)\r\n    r = kahane_simplify(t)\r\n    print(r)\r\n    assert r.equals(4*G(rho)*G(sigma))\r\n    \r\n    t = G(rho)*G(sigma)*G(mu)*G(-mu)\r\n    r = kahane_simplify(t)\r\n    print(r)\r\n    assert r.equals(4*G(rho)*G(sigma))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is\r\n```\r\n4*GammaMatrix(rho)*GammaMatrix(sigma)\r\n4*GammaMatrix(sigma)*GammaMatrix(rho)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/home/gahs/Documents/sympy/sympy-dev/test_kahane_leading_gamma_matrix_bug.py\", line 17, in test_kahane_leading_gamma_matrix_bug\r\n    assert r.equals(4*G(rho)*G(sigma))\r\nAssertionError\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth $\\gamma^\\mu \\gamma_\\mu \\gamma^\\rho \\gamma^\\sigma$ and $\\gamma^\\rho \\gamma^\\sigma \\gamma^\\mu \\gamma_\\mu$ should simplify to $4\\gamma^\\rho \\gamma^\\sigma$, but the order of $\\gamma^\\rho$ and $\\gamma^\\sigma$ is flipped in the second case due to the bug.\r\n\r\nI found the source of the bug and it is simple to fix. In `kahane_simplify()` the leading matrices are removed at the beginning of the function and then inserted at the start of the product at the end of the function, and the insertion loop is just backward.\r\n\r\nI'll generate a pull request for this shortly.\r\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.
