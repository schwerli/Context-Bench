Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1.
