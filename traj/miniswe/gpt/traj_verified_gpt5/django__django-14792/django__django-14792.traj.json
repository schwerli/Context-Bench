I think it's due to a change in the return value of timezone._get_timezone_name() that's called by the TimezoneMixin.\nOn Django 3.1 the TimezoneMixin method get_tzname() returns \"+10\" for a \"Etc/GMT-10\" time zone after calling \u200b_get_timezone_name(). This later becomes \"-10\" in the resulting query due to the return value of _prepare_tzname_delta() of the Postgres DatabaseOperations class, i.e. the time zone 10 hours east from UTC.\nSELECT ... DATE_TRUNC(\\'day\\', \"my_model\".\"start_at\" AT TIME ZONE \\'-10\\') AS \"date\" ...\nOn Django 3.2 the TimezoneMixin method get_tzname() returns \"Etc/GMT-10\" for a \"Etc/GMT-10\" time zone after calling \u200b_get_timezone_name(). This later, incorrectly, becomes \"Etc/GMT+10\" in the resulting query due to the return value of _prepare_tzname_delta() of the Postgres DatabaseOperations class, i.e. the time zone 10 hours west from UTC, which is the opposite direction from the behavior in Django 3.1.\nSELECT ...
