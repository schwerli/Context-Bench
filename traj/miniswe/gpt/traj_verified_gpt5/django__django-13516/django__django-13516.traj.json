        "instance_template": "<pr_description>\nConsider the following PR description:\n{{task}}\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1. Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in the current working directory (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.ext\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.ext | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.ext\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.ext\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.ext | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.ext | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.ext | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && (git status >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (cd */. 2>/dev/null && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (echo \"Error: No git repository found\")\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

The ``run_from_argv()`` method calls ``create_parser()`` to get\n   172\t       an ``ArgumentParser`` for the arguments, parses them, performs\n   173\t       any environment changes requested by options like\n   174\t       ``pythonpath``, and then calls the ``execute()`` method,\n   175\t       passing the parsed arguments.\n   176\t\n   177\t    3. The ``execute()`` method attempts to carry out the command by\n   178\t       calling the ``handle()`` method with the parsed arguments; any\n   179\t       output produced by ``handle()`` will be printed to standard\n   180\t       output and, if the command is intended to produce a block of\n   181\t       SQL statements, will be wrapped in ``BEGIN`` and ``COMMIT``.\n   182\t\n   183\t    4. If ``handle()`` or ``execute()`` raised any exception (e.g.\n   184\t       ``CommandError``), ``run_from_argv()`` will  instead print an error\n   185\t       message to ``stderr``.\n   186\t\n   187\t    Thus, the ``handle()`` method is typically the starting point for\n   188\t    subclasses; many built-in commands and command types either place\n   189\t    all of their logic in ``handle()``, or perform some additional\n   190\t    parsing work in ``handle()`` and then delegate from it to more\n   191\t    specialized methods as needed.\n   192\t\n   193\t    Several attributes affect behavior at various steps along the way:\n   194\t\n   195\t    ``help``\n   196\t        A short description of the command, which will be printed in\n   197\t        help messages.\n   198\t\n   199\t    ``output_transaction``\n   200\t        A boolean indicating whether the command outputs SQL\n   201\t        statements; if ``True``, the output will automatically be\n   202\t        wrapped with ``BEGIN;`` and ``COMMIT;``. Default value is\n   203\t        ``False``.\n   204\t\n   205\t    ``requires_migrations_checks``\n   206\t        A boolean; if ``True``, the command prints a warning if the set of\n   207\t        migrations on disk don't match the migrations in the database.\n   208\t\n   209\t    ``requires_system_checks``\n   210\t        A list or tuple of tags, e.g. [Tags.staticfiles, Tags.models]. System\n   211\t        checks registered in the chosen tags will be checked for errors prior\n   212\t        to executing the command. The value '__all__' can be used to specify\n   213\t        that all system checks should be performed.

I will inspect migrate.py around the lines where flush() is called to confirm usage, then implement a flush() method in OutputWrapper that forwards to self._out.flush().\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/django/core/management/commands/migrate.py\nLines: 260-310\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/django/core/management/commands/migrate.py | sed -n '260,310p'\n```",
