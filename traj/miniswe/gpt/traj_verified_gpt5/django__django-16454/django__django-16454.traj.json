These arguments are not copied into subparsers, created via CommandParser.add_subparsers().add_parser(). Missing arguments to subparsers thus end as stack traces on the CLI, rather than human-facing usage messages.\nFor example take this command with a subparser:\nfrom django.core.management.base import BaseCommand\nclass Command(BaseCommand):\n\tdef add_arguments(self, parser):\n\t\tsubparsers = parser.add_subparsers(required=True)\n\t\tcreate = subparsers.add_parser(\"create\")\n\t\tcreate.add_argument(\"name\")\n\tdef handle(self, *args, **options):\n\t\tpass\nMissing the required subparser name argument gives the usage message, as for any normal argument:\n$ ./manage.py cheeses\nusage: manage.py cheeses [-h] [--version] [-v {0,1,2,3}] [--settings SETTINGS] [--pythonpath PYTHONPATH] [--traceback] [--no-color] [--force-color] [--skip-checks] {create} ...\nmanage.py cheeses: error: the following arguments are required: {create}\nBut missing the name argument to create fails with a stacktrace:\n$ ./manage.py cheeses create\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"/Users/chainz/tmp/subparserstest/./manage.py\", line 21, in <module>\n\tmain()\n...\n File \"/Users/chainz/.pyenv/versions/3.11.0/lib/python3.11/argparse.py\", line 2131, in _parse_known_args\n\tself.error(_('the following arguments are required: %s') %\n File \"/Users/chainz/Documents/Projects/django/django/core/management/base.py\", line 72, in error\n\traise CommandError(\"Error: %s\" % message)\ndjango.core.management.base.CommandError: Error: the following arguments are required: name\nWe can correct this by ensuring that the subparser action returned by add_subparsers() copies the relevant arguments through to constructed subparsers.\n(Originally reported by Mark Gregson on django-developers: \u200bhttps://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/c/oWcaxkxQ-KI/m/4NUhLjddBwAJ )\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.

all of the mechanisms which\n   179\t    parse the command-line arguments and work out what code to call in\n   180\t    response; if you don't need to change any of that behavior,\n   181\t    consider using one of the subclasses defined in this file.\n   182\t\n   183\t    If you are interested in overriding/customizing various aspects of\n   184\t    the command-parsing and -execution behavior, the normal flow works\n   185\t    as follows:\n   186\t\n   187\t    1. ``django-admin`` or ``manage.py`` loads the command class\n   188\t       and calls its ``run_from_argv()`` method.\n   189\t\n   190\t    2. The ``run_from_argv()`` method calls ``create_parser()`` to get\n   191\t       an ``ArgumentParser`` for the arguments, parses them, performs\n   192\t       any environment changes requested by options like\n   193\t       ``pythonpath``, and then calls the ``execute()`` method,\n   194\t       passing the parsed arguments.\n   195\t\n   196\t    3. The ``execute()`` method attempts to carry out the command by\n   197\t       calling the ``handle()`` method with the parsed arguments; any\n   198\t       output produced by ``handle()`` will be printed to standard\n   199\t       output and, if the command is intended to produce a block of\n   200\t       SQL statements, will be wrapped in ``BEGIN`` and ``COMMIT``.\n   201\t\n   202\t    4. If ``handle()`` or ``execute()`` raised any exception (e.g.\n   203\t       ``CommandError``), ``run_from_argv()`` will  instead print an error\n   204\t       message to ``stderr``.\n   205\t\n   206\t    Thus, the ``handle()`` method is typically the starting point for\n   207\t    subclasses; many built-in commands and command types either place\n   208\t    all of their logic in ``handle()``, or perform some additional\n   209\t    parsing work in ``handle()`` and then delegate from it to more\n   210\t    specialized methods as needed.\n   211\t\n   212\t    Several attributes affect behavior at various steps along the way:\n   213\t\n   214\t    ``help``\n   215\t        A short description of the command, which will be printed in\n   216\t        help messages.\n   217\t\n   218\t    ``output_transaction``\n   219\t        A boolean indicating whether the command outputs SQL\n   220\t        statements; if ``True``, the output will automatically be\n   221\t        wrapped with ``BEGIN;`` and ``COMMIT;``. Default value is\n   222\t        ``False``.\n   223\t\n   224\t    ``requires_migrations_checks``\n   225\t        A boolean; if ``True``, the command prints a warning if the set of\n   226\t        migrations on disk don't match the migrations in the database.\n   227\t\n   228\t    ``requires_system_checks``\n   229\t        A list or tuple of tags, e.g. [Tags.staticfiles, Tags.models]. System\n   230\t        checks registered in the chosen tags will be checked for errors prior\n   231\t        to executing the command. The value '__all__' can be used to specify\n   232\t        that all system checks should be performed. Default value is '__all__'.\n   233\t\n   234\t        To validate an individual application's models\n   235\t        rather than all applications' models, call\n   236\t        ``self.check(app_configs)`` from ``handle()``, where ``app_configs``\n   237\t        is the list of application's configuration provided by the\n   238\t        app registry.\n   239\t\n   240\t    ``stealth_options``\n</output>",
