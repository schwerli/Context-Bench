Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4.

For B as an Interval and A as a FiniteSet, the current logic filters out elements with contains(el) == True and keeps the rest, which drops numbers inside the interval and retains symbols, resulting in {x, y}. Instead, when there are elements with unknown membership (like symbols), we should keep the result partially unevaluated: return the union of elements definitely outside and a Complement of the unknown elements with the subtracting set.
