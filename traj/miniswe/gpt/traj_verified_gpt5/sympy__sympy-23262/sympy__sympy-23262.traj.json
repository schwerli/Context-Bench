I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side?

Use an ordered iterable such as a list or tuple.\n\n    Explanation\n    ===========\n\n    For example, to convert the SymPy expression ``sin(x) + cos(x)`` to an\n    equivalent NumPy function that numerically evaluates it:\n\n    >>> from sympy import sin, cos, symbols, lambdify\n    >>> import numpy as np\n    >>> x = symbols('x')\n    >>> expr = sin(x) + cos(x)\n    >>> expr\n    sin(x) + cos(x)\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, expr, 'numpy')\n    >>> a = np.array([1, 2])\n    >>> f(a)\n    [1.38177329 0.49315059]\n\n    The primary purpose of this function is to provide a bridge from SymPy\n    expressions to numerical libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, NumExpr, mpmath,\n    and tensorflow. In general, SymPy functions do not work with objects from\n    other libraries, such as NumPy arrays, and functions from numeric\n    libraries like NumPy or mpmath do not work on SymPy expressions.\n    ``lambdify`` bridges the two by converting a SymPy expression to an\n    equivalent numeric function.\n\n    The basic workflow with ``lambdify`` is to first create a SymPy expression\n    representing whatever mathematical function you wish to evaluate. This\n    should be done using only SymPy functions and expressions. Then, use\n    ``lambdify`` to convert this to an equivalent function for numerical\n    evaluation. For instance, above we created ``expr`` using the SymPy symbol\n    ``x`` and SymPy functions ``sin`` and ``cos``, then converted it to an\n    equivalent NumPy function ``f``, and called it on a NumPy array ``a``.\n\n    Parameters\n    ==========\n\n    args : List[Symbol]\n        A variable or a list of variables whose nesting represents the\n        nesting of the arguments that will be passed to the function.\n\n        Variables can be symbols, undefined functions, or matrix symbols.\n\n        >>> from sympy import Eq\n        >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z\n\n        The list of variables should match the structure of how the\n        arguments will be passed to the function. Simply enclose the\n        parameters as they will be passed in a list.\n\n        To call a function like ``f(x)`` then ``[x]``\n        should be the first argument to ``lambdify``; for this\n        case a single ``x`` can also be used:\n\n        >>> f = lambdify(x, x + 1)\n        >>> f(1)\n        2\n        >>> f = lambdify([x], x + 1)\n        >>> f(1)\n        2\n\n        To call a function like ``f(x, y)`` then ``[x, y]`` will\n        be the first argument of the ``lambdify``:\n\n        >>> f = lambdify([x, y], x + y)\n        >>> f(1, 1)\n        2\n\n        To call a function with a single 3-element tuple like\n        ``f((x, y, z))`` then ``[(x, y, z)]`` will be the first\n        argument of the ``lambdify``:\n\n        >>> f = lambdify([(x, y, z)], Eq(z**2, x**2 + y**2))\n        >>> f((3, 4, 5))\n        True\n\n        If two args will be passed and the first is a scalar but\n        the second is a tuple with two arguments then the items\n        in the list should match that structure:\n\n        >>> f = lambdify([x, (y, z)], x + y + z)\n        >>> f(1, (2, 3))\n        6\n\n    expr : Expr\n        An expression, list of expressions, or matrix to be evaluated.\n\n        Lists may be nested.\n        If the expression is a list, the output will also be a list.\n\n        >>> f = lambdify(x, [x, [x + 1, x + 2]])\n        >>> f(1)\n        [1, [2, 3]]\n\n        If it is a matrix, an array will be returned (for the NumPy module).\n\n        >>> from sympy import Matrix\n        >>> f = lambdify(x, Matrix([x, x + 1]))\n        >>> f(1)\n        [[1]\n        [2]]\n\n        Note that the argument order here (variables then expression) is used\n        to emulate the Python ``lambda`` keyword. ``lambdify(x, expr)`` works\n        (roughly) like ``lambda x: expr``\n        (see :ref:`lambdify-how-it-works` below).\n\n    modules : str, optional\n        Specifies the numeric library to use.\n\n        If not specified, *modules* defaults to:\n\n        - ``[\"scipy\", \"numpy\"]`` if SciPy is installed\n        - ``[\"numpy\"]`` if only NumPy is installed\n        - ``[\"math\", \"mpmath\", \"sympy\"]`` if neither is installed.\n\n        That is, SymPy functions are replaced as far as possible by\n        either ``scipy`` or ``numpy`` functions if available, and Python's\n        standard library ``math``, or ``mpmath`` functions otherwise.\n\n        *modules* can be one of the following types:\n\n        - The strings ``\"math\"``, ``\"mpmath\"``, ``\"numpy\"``, ``\"numexpr\"``,\n          ``\"scipy\"``, ``\"sympy\"``, or ``\"tensorflow\"``. This uses the\n          corresponding printer and namespace mapping for that module.\n        - A module (e.g., ``math``). This uses the global namespace of the\n          module. If the module is one of the above known modules, it will\n\n</output_tail>",

''', module_dictionary)\n    >>> sin_cos = module_dictionary['sin_cos']\n    >>> sin_cos(1)\n    1.38177329068\n\n    So now we can get an idea of how ``lambdify`` works. The name \"lambdify\"\n    comes from the fact that we can think of something like ``lambdify(x,\n    sin(x) + cos(x), 'numpy')`` as ``lambda x: sin(x) + cos(x)``, where\n    ``sin`` and ``cos`` come from the ``numpy`` namespace. This is also why\n    the symbols argument is first in ``lambdify``, as opposed to most SymPy\n    functions where it comes after the expression: to better mimic the\n    ``lambda`` keyword.\n\n    ``lambdify`` takes the input expression (like ``sin(x) + cos(x)``) and\n\n    1. Converts it to a string\n    2. Creates a module globals dictionary based on the modules that are\n       passed in (by default, it uses the NumPy module)\n    3. Creates the string ``\"def func({vars}): return {expr}\"``, where ``{vars}`` is the\n       list of variables separated by commas, and ``{expr}`` is the string\n       created in step 1., then ``exec``s that string with the module globals\n       namespace and returns ``func``.\n\n    In fact, functions returned by ``lambdify`` support inspection. So you can\n    see exactly how they are defined by using ``inspect.getsource``, or ``??`` if you\n    are using IPython or the Jupyter notebook.\n\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x) + cos(x))\n    >>> import inspect\n    >>> print(inspect.getsource(f))\n    def _lambdifygenerated(x):\n        return sin(x) + cos(x)\n\n    This shows us the source code of the function, but not the namespace it\n    was defined in. We can inspect that by looking at the ``__globals__``\n    attribute of ``f``:\n\n    >>> f.__globals__['sin']\n    <ufunc 'sin'>\n    >>> f.__globals__['cos']\n    <ufunc 'cos'>\n    >>> f.__globals__['sin'] is numpy.sin\n    True\n\n    This shows us that ``sin`` and ``cos`` in the namespace of ``f`` will be\n    ``numpy.sin`` and ``numpy.cos``.\n\n    Note that there are some convenience layers in each of these steps, but at\n    the core, this is how ``lambdify`` works. Step 1 is done using the\n    ``LambdaPrinter`` printers defined in the printing module (see\n    :mod:`sympy.printing.lambdarepr`). This allows different SymPy expressions\n    to define how they should be converted to a string for different modules.\n    You can change which printer ``lambdify`` uses by passing a custom printer\n    in to the ``printer`` argument.\n\n    Step 2 is augmented by certain translations. There are default\n    translations for each module, but you can provide your own by passing a\n    list to the ``modules`` argument. For instance,\n\n    >>> def mysin(x):\n    ...     print('taking the sin of', x)\n    ...     return numpy.sin(x)\n    ...\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x), [{'sin': mysin}, 'numpy'])\n    >>> f(1)\n    taking the sin of 1\n    0.8414709848078965\n\n    The globals dictionary is generated from the list by merging the\n    dictionary ``{'sin': mysin}`` and the module dictionary for NumPy. The\n    merging is done so that earlier items take precedence, which is why\n    ``mysin`` is used above instead of ``numpy.sin``.\n\n    If you want to modify the way ``lambdify`` works for a given function, it\n    is usually easiest to do so by modifying the globals dictionary as such.\n    In more complicated cases, it may be necessary to create and pass in a\n    custom printer.\n\n    Finally, step 3 is augmented with certain convenience operations, such as\n    the addition of a docstring.\n\n    Understanding how ``lambdify`` works can make it easier to avoid certain\n    gotchas when using it. For instance, a common mistake is to create a\n    lambdified function for one module (say, NumPy), and pass it objects from\n    another (say, a SymPy expression).\n\n    For instance, say we create\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n    >>> f = lambdify(x, x + 1, 'numpy')\n\n    Now if we pass in a NumPy array, we get that array plus 1\n\n    >>> import numpy\n    >>> a = numpy.array([1, 2])\n    >>> f(a)\n    [2 3]\n\n    But what happens if you make the mistake of passing in a SymPy expression\n    instead of a NumPy array:\n\n    >>> f(x + 1)\n    x + 2\n\n    This worked, but it was only by accident. Now take a different lambdified\n    function:\n\n    >>> from sympy import sin\n    >>> g = lambdify(x, x + sin(x), 'numpy')\n\n    This works as expected on NumPy arrays:\n\n    >>> g(a)\n    [1.84147098 2.90929743]\n\n    But if we try to pass in a SymPy expression, it fails\n\n    >>> try:\n    ...     g(x + 1)\n    ... # NumPy release after 1.17 raises TypeError instead of\n    ... # AttributeError\n    ... except (AttributeError, TypeError):\n    ...     raise AttributeError() # doctest: +IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    AttributeError:\n\n    Now, let's look at what happened. The reason this fails is that ``g``\n    calls ``numpy.sin`` on the input expression, and ``numpy.sin`` does not\n    know how to operate on a SymPy object. **As a general rule, NumPy\n    functions do not know how to operate on SymPy expressions, and SymPy\n    functions do not know how to operate on NumPy arrays. This is why lambdify\n    exists: to provide a bridge between SymPy and NumPy.**\n\n    However, why is it that ``f`` did work? That's because ``f`` does not call\n    any functions, it only adds 1. So the resulting function that is created,\n    ``def _lambdifygenerated(x): return x + 1`` does not depend on the globals\n    namespace it is defined in. Thus it works, but only by accident. A future\n    version of ``lambdify`` may remove this behavior.\n\n    Be aware that certain implementation details described here may change in\n    future versions of SymPy. The API of passing in custom modules and\n    printers will not change, but the details of how a lambda function is\n    created may change. However, the basic idea will remain the same, and\n    understanding it will be helpful to understanding the behavior of\n    lambdify.\n\n    **In general: you should create lambdified functions for one module (say,\n    NumPy), and only pass it input types that are compatible with that module\n    (say, NumPy arrays).** Remember that by default, if the ``module``\n    argument is not provided, ``lambdify`` creates functions using the NumPy\n    and SciPy namespaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    from sympy.core.symbol import Symbol\n    from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n\n    # If the user hasn't specified any modules, use what is available.\n    if modules is None:\n        try:\n            _import(\"scipy\")\n        except ImportError:\n            try:\n                _import(\"numpy\")\n            except ImportError:\n                # Use either numpy (if available) or python.math where possible.\n                # XXX: This leads to different behaviour on different systems and\n                #      might be the reason for irreproducible errors.\n                modules = [\"math\", \"mpmath\", \"sympy\"]\n            else:\n                modules = [\"numpy\"]\n        else:\n            modules = [\"numpy\", \"scipy\"]\n\n    # Get the needed namespaces.\n    namespaces = []\n    # First find any function implementations\n    if use_imps:\n        namespaces.append(_imp_namespace(expr))\n    # Check for dict before iterating\n    if isinstance(modules, (dict, str)) or not hasattr(modules, '__iter__'):\n        namespaces.append(modules)\n    else:\n        # consistency check\n        if _module_present('numexpr', modules) and len(modules) > 1:\n            raise TypeError(\"numexpr must be the only item in 'modules'\")\n        namespaces += list(modules)\n    # fill namespace with first having highest priority\n    namespace = {} # type: tDict[str, Any]\n    for m in namespaces[::-1]:\n        buf = _get_namespace(m)\n        namespace.update(buf)\n\n    if hasattr(expr, \"atoms\"):\n        #Try if you can extract symbols from the expression.\n        #Move on if expr.atoms in not implemented.\n        syms = expr.atoms(Symbol)\n        for term in syms:\n            namespace.update({str(term): term})\n\n    if printer is None:\n        if _module_present('mpmath', namespaces):\n            from sympy.printing.pycode import MpmathPrinter as Printer # type: ignore\n        elif _module_present('scipy', namespaces):\n            from sympy.printing.numpy import SciPyPrinter as Printer # type: ignore\n        elif _module_present('numpy', namespaces):\n            from sympy.printing.numpy import NumPyPrinter as Printer # type: ignore\n        elif _module_present('cupy', namespaces):\n            from sympy.printing.numpy import CuPyPrinter as Printer # type: ignore\n        elif _module_present('numexpr', namespaces):\n            from sympy.printing.lambdarepr import NumExprPrinter as Printer # type: ignore\n        elif _module_present('tensorflow', namespaces):\n            from sympy.printing.tensorflow import TensorflowPrinter as Printer # type: ignore\n        elif _module_present('sympy', namespaces):\n            from sympy.printing.pycode import SymPyPrinter as Printer # type: ignore\n        else:\n</output>",
