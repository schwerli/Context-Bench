Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in the current working directory (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1.

Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.ext\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.ext | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.ext\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.ext\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.ext | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.ext | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.ext | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && (git status >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (cd */. 2>/dev/null && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (echo \"Error: No git repository found\")\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

Nested\n    53\t    inputs are not supported (e.g. lists of list or dicts of dict).\n    54\t\n    55\t    A new Functional API model can also be created by using the\n    56\t    intermediate tensors. This enables you to quickly extract sub-components\n    57\t    of the model.\n    58\t\n    59\t    Example:\n    60\t\n    61\t    ```python\n    62\t    inputs = keras.Input(shape=(None, None, 3))\n    63\t    processed = keras.layers.RandomCrop(width=128, height=128)(inputs)\n    64\t    conv = keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=3)(processed)\n    65\t    pooling = keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(conv)\n    66\t    feature = keras.layers.Dense(10)(pooling)\n    67\t\n    68\t    full_model = keras.Model(inputs, feature)\n    69\t    backbone = keras.Model(processed, conv)\n    70\t    activations = keras.Model(conv, feature)\n    71\t    ```\n    72\t\n    73\t    Note that the `backbone` and `activations` models are not\n    74\t    created with `keras.Input` objects, but with the tensors that originate\n    75\t    from `keras.Input` objects. Under the hood, the layers and weights will\n    76\t    be shared across these models, so that user can train the `full_model`, and\n    77\t    use `backbone` or `activations` to do feature extraction.\n    78\t    The inputs and outputs of the model can be nested structures of tensors as\n    79\t    well, and the created models are standard Functional API models that support\n    80\t    all the existing APIs.\n    81\t\n    82\t    ## By subclassing the `Model` class\n    83\t\n    84\t    In that case, you should define your\n    85\t    layers in `__init__()` and you should implement the model's forward pass\n    86\t    in `call()`.\n    87\t\n    88\t    ```python\n    89\t    class MyModel(keras.Model):\n    90\t        def __init__(self):\n    91\t            super().__init__()\n    92\t            self.dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(32, activation=\"relu\")\n    93\t            self.dense2 = keras.layers.Dense(5, activation=\"softmax\")\n    94\t\n    95\t        def call(self, inputs):\n    96\t            x = self.dense1(inputs)\n    97\t            return self.dense2(x)\n    98\t\n    99\t    model = MyModel()\n   100\t    ```\n   101\t\n   102\t    If you subclass `Model`, you can optionally have\n   103\t    a `training` argument (boolean) in `call()`, which you can use to specify\n   104\t    a different behavior in training and inference:\n   105\t\n   106\t    ```python\n   107\t    class MyModel(keras.Model):\n   108\t        def __init__(self):\n   109\t            super().__init__()\n   110\t            self.dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(32, activation=\"relu\")\n   111\t            self.dense2 = keras.layers.Dense(5, activation=\"softmax\")\n   112\t            self.dropout = keras.layers.Dropout(0.5)\n   113\t\n   114\t        def call(self, inputs, training=False):\n   115\t            x = self.dense1(inputs)\n   116\t            x = self.dropout(x, training=train\n</output_head>\n<elided_chars>\n12579 characters elided\n</elided_chars>\n<output_tail>\nport([\"keras.saving.load_model\", \"keras.models.load_model\"])\n   114\tdef load_model(filepath, custom_objects=None, compile=True, safe_mode=True):\n   115\t    \"\"\"Loads a model saved via `model.save()`.\n   116\t\n   117\t    Args:\n   118\t        filepath: `str` or `pathlib.Path` object, path to the saved model file.\n   119\t        custom_objects: Optional dictionary mapping names\n   120\t            (strings) to custom classes or functions to be\n   121\t            considered during deserialization.\n   122\t        compile: Boolean, whether to compile the model after loading.\n   123\t        safe_mode: Boolean, whether to disallow unsafe `lambda` deserialization.\n   124\t            When `safe_mode=False`, loading an object has the potential to\n   125\t            trigger arbitrary code execution.
