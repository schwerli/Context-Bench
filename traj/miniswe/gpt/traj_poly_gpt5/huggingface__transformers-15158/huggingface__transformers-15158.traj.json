A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this\n            token instead.\n        sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `\"[SEP]\"`):\n            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for\n            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last\n            token of a sequence built with special tokens.\n        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `\"[PAD]\"`):\n            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.\n        cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `\"[CLS]\"`):\n            The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence\n            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.\n        mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `\"[MASK]\"`):\n            The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language\n            modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.\n        clean_text (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether or not to clean the text before tokenization by removing any control characters and replacing all\n            whitespaces by the classic one.\n        tokenize_chinese_chars (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether or not to tokenize Chinese characters.

Based on WordPiece.\n\n    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should\n    refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.\n\n    Args:\n        vocab_file (`str`):\n            File containing the vocabulary.\n        do_lower_case (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether or not to lowercase the input when tokenizing.\n        unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `\"[UNK]\"`):\n            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this\n            token instead.\n        sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `\"[SEP]\"`):\n            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for\n            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last\n            token of a sequence built with special tokens.\n        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `\"[PAD]\"`):\n            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.\n        cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `\"[CLS]\"`):\n            The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence\n            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.\n        mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `\"[MASK]\"`):\n            The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language\n            modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.\n        question_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `\"[QUESTION]\"`):\n            The token used for constructing question representations.\n        clean_text (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether or not to clean the text before tokenization by removing any control characters and replacing all\n            whitespaces by the classic one.\n        tokenize_chinese_chars (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether or not to tokenize Chinese characters. This should likely be deactivated for Japanese (see [this\n            issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/328)).\n        strip_accents: (`bool`, *optional*):\n            Whether or not to strip all accents.
