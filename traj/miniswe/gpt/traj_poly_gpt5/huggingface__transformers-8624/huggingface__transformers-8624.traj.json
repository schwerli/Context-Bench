The current code uses optimizer steps per epoch (num_update_steps_per_epoch), but skipping is done per dataloader iteration (micro-steps). We'll modify src/transformers/trainer.py so that, when the train dataset is sized, we compute these values using (global_step * gradient_accumulation_steps) with len(train_dataloader). We'll fall back to the existing logic for unsized datasets.\n\n```bash\npython - <<'PY'\nimport io,sys,re,os\np=\"src/transformers/trainer.py\"\nwith open(p,'r',encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    s=f.read()\npattern = (\n    r'(\\n\\s*# Check if continuing training from a checkpoint\\n'\n    r'\\s*if model_path and os.path.isfile\\(os\\.path\\.join\\(model_path, \"trainer_state\\.json\"\\)\\):\\n'\n    r'\\s*self\\.state = TrainerState\\.load_from_json\\(os\\.path\\.join\\(model_path, \"trainer_state\\.json\"\\)\\)\\n)'\n    r'\\s*epochs_trained = self\\.state\\.global_step // num_update_steps_per_epoch\\n'\n    r'\\s*steps_trained_in_current_epoch = self\\.state\\.global_step % \\(num_update_steps_per_epoch\\)\\n'\n)\nrepl = (\n    r'\\1'\n    r'            if train_dataset_is_sized:\\n'\n    r'                epochs_trained = (self.state.global_step * self.args.gradient_accumulation_steps) // len(train_dataloader)\\n'\n    r'                steps_trained_in_current_epoch = (self.state.global_step * self.args.gradient_accumulation_steps) % len(train_dataloader)\\n'\n    r'            else:\\n'\n    r'                epochs_trained = self.state.global_step // num_update_steps_per_epoch\\n'\n    r'                steps_trained_in_current_epoch = self.state.global_step % (num_update_steps_per_epoch)\\n'\n)\nns, n = re.subn(pattern, repl, s, flags=re.M)\nif n==0:\n    print(\"No changes made; pattern not found.\", file=sys.stderr)\nelse:\n    with open(p,'w',encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        f.write(ns)\n    print(f\"Patched {p} ({n} occurrence).\")\n# Show the modified block for verification\nimport subprocess, textwrap\nout = subprocess.check_output([\"nl\",\"-ba\",p], text=True)\nlines = out.splitlines()\n# Find the around lines where the checkpoint logic exists\nstart = None\nfor i,l in enumerate(lines):\n    if \"Check if continuing training from a checkpoint\" in l:\n        start = i\n        break\nif start is not None:\n    print(\"\\n\".join(lines[start:start+20]))\nelse:\n    print(\"Verification slice not found.\", file=sys.stderr)\nPY\n```",
