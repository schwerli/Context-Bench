I don't see a step where we remove the properties from `config_dict` that are mentioned in `kwargs`, although there is a comment right above that says: `# remove all the arguments that are in the config_dict`\r\n\r\nWouldn't the code need to do something more like this?\r\n```\r\nconfig_dict_copy = config_dict.copy()\r\nconfig_dict_copy.update(kwargs)\r\nconfig = cls(**config_dict_copy)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy generation_config.json from my model is this:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"decoder_start_token_id\": 0,\r\n  \"eos_token_id\": 1,\r\n  \"length_penalty\": 0,\r\n  \"max_length\": 32,\r\n  \"num_beams\": 2,\r\n  \"num_return_sequences\": 2,\r\n  \"output_scores\": true,\r\n  \"pad_token_id\": 0,\r\n  \"return_dict_in_generate\": true,\r\n  \"transformers_version\": \"4.30.0.dev0\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThis should not throw an exception:\r\n```python\r\ngeneration_config: GenerationConfig = GenerationConfig.from_pretrained(\r\n        \"My-model\",\r\n        num_beams=num_beams)\r\n```\r\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.
