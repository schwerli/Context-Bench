                "content": "THOUGHT: I will modify DataCollatorForSeq2Seq so that when padding strategy is MAX_LENGTH and a max_length is provided, labels are padded to that max_length (ensuring consistency with input_ids). For other strategies, labels will continue to be padded to the maximum label length (optionally aligned to pad_to_multiple_of).

For other strategies, labels continue to pad to the longest label length (optionally aligned with pad_to_multiple_of). I fixed an indentation issue and verified behavior with a dummy tokenizer to confirm shapes align as expected.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
