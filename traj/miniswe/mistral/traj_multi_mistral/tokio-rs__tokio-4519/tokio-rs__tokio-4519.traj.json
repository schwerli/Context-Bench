Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in the current working directory (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.ext\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.ext | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.ext\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.ext\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.ext | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.ext | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Multi-SWE-bench Specific Notes\n- You are working in a Multi-SWE-bench environment with multi-language repositories\n- The project may be in a subdirectory (e.g., /home/repo-name/)\n- Git repository is typically located in the project subdirectory\n- When working with Git operations, ensure you're in the correct repository directory\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.ext\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.ext\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.ext | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && (git status >/dev/null 2>&1 && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (cd */. 2>/dev/null && git add -A && git diff --cached) || (find . -name '.git' -type d -exec sh -c 'cd \"$(dirname \"{}\")\" && git add -A && git diff --cached' \\; 2>/dev/null | head -n 1000) || (echo \"Error: No git repository found\")\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

Once the **first** expression\n/// completes with a value that matches its `<pattern>`, the `select!` macro\n/// returns the result of evaluating the completed branch's `<handler>`\n/// expression.\n///\n/// Additionally, each branch may include an optional `if` precondition. If the\n/// precondition returns `false`, then the branch is disabled. The provided\n/// `<async expression>` is still evaluated but the resulting future is never\n/// polled. This capability is useful when using `select!` within a loop.\n///\n/// The complete lifecycle of a `select!` expression is as follows:\n///\n/// 1. Evaluate all provided `<precondition>` expressions. If the precondition\n///    returns `false`, disable the branch for the remainder of the current call\n///    to `select!`. Re-entering `select!` due to a loop clears the \"disabled\"\n///    state.\n/// 2. Aggregate the `<async expression>`s from each branch, including the\n///    disabled ones. If the branch is disabled, `<async expression>` is still\n///    evaluated, but the resulting future is not polled.\n/// 3. Concurrently await on the results for all remaining `<async expression>`s.\n/// 4. Once an `<async expression>` returns a value, attempt to apply the value\n///    to the provided `<pattern>`, if the pattern matches, evaluate `<handler>`\n///    and return. If the pattern **does not** match, disable the current branch\n///    and for the remainder of the current call to `select!`. Continue from step 3.\n/// 5. If **all** branches are disabled, evaluate the `else` expression. If no\n///    else branch is provided, panic.\n///\n/// # Runtime characteristics\n///\n/// By running all async expressions on the current task, the expressions are\n/// able to run **concurrently** but not in **parallel**. This means all\n/// expressions are run on the same thread and if one branch blocks the thread,\n/// all other expressions will be unable to continue. If parallelism is\n/// required, spawn each async expression using [`tokio::spawn`] and pass the\n/// join handle to `select!`.\n///\n/// [`tokio::spawn`]: crate::spawn\n///\n/// # Fairness\n///\n/// By default, `select!` randomly picks a branch to check first. This provides\n/// some level of fairness when calling `select!` in a loop with branches that\n/// are always ready.\n///\n/// This behavior can be overridden by adding `biased;` to the beginning of the\n/// macro usage. See the examples for details. This will cause `select` to poll\n/// the futures in the order they appear from top to bottom. There are a few\n/// reasons you may want this:\n///\n/// - The random number generation of `tokio::select!` has a non-zero CPU cost\n/// - Your futures may interact in a way where known polling order is significant\n///\n/// But there is an important caveat to this mode. It becomes your responsibility\n/// to ensure that the polling order of your futures is fair. If for example you\n/// are selecting between a stream and a shutdown future, and the stream has a\n/// huge volume of messages and zero or nearly zero time between them, you should\n/// place the shutdown future earlier in the `select!` list to ensure that it is\n/// always polled, and will not be ignored due to the stream being constantly\n/// ready.\n///\n/// # Panics\n///\n/// The `select!` macro panics if all branches are disabled **and** there is no\n/// provided `else` branch. A branch is disabled when the provided `if`\n/// precondition returns `false` **or** when the pattern does not match the\n/// result of `<async expression>`.\n///\n/// # Cancellation safety\n///\n/// When using `select!` in a loop to receive messages from multiple sources,\n/// you should make sure that the receive call is cancellation safe to avoid\n/// losing messages. This section goes through various common methods and\n/// describes whether they are cancel safe.  The lists in this section are not\n/// exhaustive.\n///\n/// The following methods are cancellation safe:\n///\n///  * [`tokio::sync::mpsc::Receiver::recv`](crate::sync::mpsc::Receiver::recv)\n///  * [`tokio::sync::mpsc::UnboundedReceiver::recv`](crate::sync::mpsc::UnboundedReceiver::recv)\n///  * [`tokio::sync::broadcast::Receiver::recv`](crate::sync::broadcast::Receiver::recv)\n///  * [`tokio::sync::watch::Receiver::changed`](crate::sync::watch::Receiver::changed)\n///  * \n</output_head>\n<elided_chars>\n29069 characters elided\n</elided_chars>\n<output_tail>\n, (_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
