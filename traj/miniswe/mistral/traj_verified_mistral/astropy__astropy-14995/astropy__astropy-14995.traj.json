Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, project configuration files (e.g., build configs, lockfiles, CI configs), or environment setup unless the PR description explicitly requires it.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n## Explore-context Marking (STRICT, REQUIRED FOR FILE READING)\nWhen you are exploring code context (reading files / printing line ranges), you MUST include a machine-parseable\nexplore-context block BEFORE your bash code block. This is independent of the command you use (cat/sed/nl/head/etc).\n\n**When NOT to include `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>`:**\n- Do NOT include it for non-reading exploration like `ls -la`, `find`, `rg/grep` (search-only), `git status`, etc.\n- Only include it when your command will PRINT actual source code content (a file snippet / line range) to stdout\n  for you to read.\n\n**Explore-context block format (STRICT):**\n- MUST be enclosed in `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT> ... </EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` tags.\n- Inside, include ONE OR MORE entries, each entry exactly:\n  `File: /absolute/path/to/file.ext`\n  `Lines: <start>-<end>`\n- Multiple entries are separated by a blank line.\n- Use ABSOLUTE paths only.\n- `<start>` and `<end>` MUST be positive integers and `<start> <= <end>`.\n- Do NOT include any other text (no explanation, no code, no extra keys).\n\n**Command/output consistency (STRICT):**\nYour bash command MUST print the declared file line range(s) to stdout (the terminal output we see),\nso we can map `<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>` entries to the observed `<output>` content.\n\n**Good examples:**\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/foo.py\nLines: 10-40\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\nnl -ba /testbed/src/foo.py | sed -n '10,40p'\n```\n\n<EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\nFile: /testbed/src/a.py\nLines: 1-80\n\nFile: /testbed/src/b.py\nLines: 120-160\n</EXPLORE_CONTEXT>\n\n```bash\n(nl -ba /testbed/src/a.py | sed -n '1,80p' && echo '---' && nl -ba /testbed/src/b.py | sed -n '120,160p')\n```\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.txt\nhello world\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.

This behavior is also explained in the docstring for the\n   132\t    different arithmetic operations.\n   133\t\n   134\t    Decomposing the units is not attempted, mainly due to the internal mechanics\n   135\t    of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, so the resulting data might have units like\n   136\t    ``km/m`` if you divided for example 100km by 5m. So this Mixin has adopted\n   137\t    this behavior.\n   138\t\n   139\t    Examples\n   140\t    --------\n   141\t    Using this Mixin with `~astropy.nddata.NDData`:\n   142\t\n   143\t        >>> from astropy.nddata import NDData, NDArithmeticMixin\n   144\t        >>> class NDDataWithMath(NDArithmeticMixin, NDData):\n   145\t        ...     pass\n   146\t\n   147\t    Using it with one operand on an instance::\n   148\t\n   149\t        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(100)\n   150\t        >>> ndd.add(20)\n   151\t        NDDataWithMath(120)\n   152\t\n   153\t    Using it with two operand on an instance::\n   154\t\n   155\t        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(-4)\n   156\t        >>> ndd.divide(1, ndd)\n   157\t        NDDataWithMath(-0.25)\n   158\t\n   159\t    Using it as classmethod requires two operands::\n   160\t\n   161\t        >>> NDDataWithMath.subtract(5, 4)\n   162\t        NDDataWithMath(1)\n   163\t\n   164\t    \"\"\"\n   165\t\n   166\t    def _arithmetic(\n   167\t        self,\n   168\t        operation,\n   169\t        operand,\n   170\t        propagate_uncertainties=True,\n   171\t        handle_mask=np.logical_or,\n   172\t        handle_meta=None,\n   173\t        uncertainty_correlation=0,\n   174\t        compare_wcs=\"first_found\",\n   175\t        operation_ignores_mask=False,\n   176\t        axis=None,\n   177\t        **kwds,\n   178\t    ):\n   179\t        \"\"\"\n   180\t        Base method which calculates the result of the arithmetic operation.\n   181\t\n   182\t        This method determines the result of the arithmetic operation on the\n   183\t        ``data`` including their units and then forwards to other methods\n   184\t        to calculate the other properties for the result (like uncertainty).\n   185\t\n   186\t        Parameters\n   187\t        ----------\n   188\t        operation : callable\n   189\t            The operation that is performed on the `NDData`.
