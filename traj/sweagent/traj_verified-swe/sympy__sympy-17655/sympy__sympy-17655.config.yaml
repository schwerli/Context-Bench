  Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent
  across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view`

  non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot
  be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates
  a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit`
  command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\nNotes for using the
  `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more
  consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str`
  parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make
