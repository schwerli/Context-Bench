The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

Please use `str_replace_editor view` with the `view_range` parameter to show selected lines next.</NOTE>\n     1 \"\"\"\n     2 Implementation of the trigsimp algorithm by Fu et al.\n     3 \n     4 The idea behind the ``fu`` algorithm is to use a sequence of rules, applied\n     5 in what is heuristically known to be a smart order, to select a simpler\n     6 expression that is equivalent to the input.\n     7 \n     8 There are transform rules in which a single rule is applied to the\n     9 expression tree. The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

Please use `str_replace_editor view` with the `view_range` parameter to show selected lines next.</NOTE>\n     1 \"\"\"\n     2 Implementation of the trigsimp algorithm by Fu et al.\n     3 \n     4 The idea behind the ``fu`` algorithm is to use a sequence of rules, applied\n     5 in what is heuristically known to be a smart order, to select a simpler\n     6 expression that is equivalent to the input.\n     7 \n     8 There are transform rules in which a single rule is applied to the\n     9 expression tree. The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

Please use `str_replace_editor view` with the `view_range` parameter to show selected lines next.</NOTE>\n     1 \"\"\"\n     2 Implementation of the trigsimp algorithm by Fu et al.\n     3 \n     4 The idea behind the ``fu`` algorithm is to use a sequence of rules, applied\n     5 in what is heuristically known to be a smart order, to select a simpler\n     6 expression that is equivalent to the input.\n     7 \n     8 There are transform rules in which a single rule is applied to the\n     9 expression tree. The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

Please use `str_replace_editor view` with the `view_range` parameter to show selected lines next.</NOTE>\n     1 \"\"\"\n     2 Implementation of the trigsimp algorithm by Fu et al.\n     3 \n     4 The idea behind the ``fu`` algorithm is to use a sequence of rules, applied\n     5 in what is heuristically known to be a smart order, to select a simpler\n     6 expression that is equivalent to the input.\n     7 \n     8 There are transform rules in which a single rule is applied to the\n     9 expression tree. The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

Please use `str_replace_editor view` with the `view_range` parameter to show selected lines next.</NOTE>\n     1 \"\"\"\n     2 Implementation of the trigsimp algorithm by Fu et al.\n     3 \n     4 The idea behind the ``fu`` algorithm is to use a sequence of rules, applied\n     5 in what is heuristically known to be a smart order, to select a simpler\n     6 expression that is equivalent to the input.\n     7 \n     8 There are transform rules in which a single rule is applied to the\n     9 expression tree. The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

Please use `str_replace_editor view` with the `view_range` parameter to show selected lines next.</NOTE>\n     1 \"\"\"\n     2 Implementation of the trigsimp algorithm by Fu et al.\n     3 \n     4 The idea behind the ``fu`` algorithm is to use a sequence of rules, applied\n     5 in what is heuristically known to be a smart order, to select a simpler\n     6 expression that is equivalent to the input.\n     7 \n     8 There are transform rules in which a single rule is applied to the\n     9 expression tree. The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

Please use `str_replace_editor view` with the `view_range` parameter to show selected lines next.</NOTE>\n     1 \"\"\"\n     2 Implementation of the trigsimp algorithm by Fu et al.\n     3 \n     4 The idea behind the ``fu`` algorithm is to use a sequence of rules, applied\n     5 in what is heuristically known to be a smart order, to select a simpler\n     6 expression that is equivalent to the input.\n     7 \n     8 There are transform rules in which a single rule is applied to the\n     9 expression tree. The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n    10 docstrings for examples.\n    11 \n    12     TR0 - simplify expression\n    13     TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    14     TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    15     TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    16     TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    17     TR4 - functions at special angles\n    18     TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    19     TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    20     TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    21     TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    22     TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    23     TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    24     TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    25     TR11 - reduce double angles\n    26     TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    27     TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    28     TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    29     TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    30     TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    31     TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    32     TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    33     TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    34     TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n    35 \n    36 There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n    37 transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n    38 a few options.\n    39 \n    40 Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n    41 sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n    42 algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n    43 best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n    44 of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n    45 \n    46 Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n    47 e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n    48 ``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n    49 traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n    50 attempted. For example,\n    51 \n    52     Set-up for examples below:\n    53 \n    54     >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    55     >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    56     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    57     >>> from time import time\n    58 \n    59 >>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    60 >>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n    61 -sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n    62 \n    63 If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n    64 the transformation is successful:\n    65 \n    66 >>> TR10i(_.normal())\n    67 cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n    68 \n    69 TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n    70 doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n    71 \n    72 >>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n    73 (2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n    74 >>> powsimp(_)\n    75 (2*sin(1))**a\n    76 \n    77 The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n    78 be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n    79 well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n    80 recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n    81 \n    82 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n    83 a*cos(x - y)\n    84 \n    85 Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n    86 until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n    87 help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n    88 ``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n    89 (but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n    90 \n    91 >>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n    92 a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n    93 \n    94 In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n    95 to make that decision. For example:\n    96 \n    97 >>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n    98 ... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n    99 ... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n   100 ... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n   101 \n   102 In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n   103 \n   104 >>> L(expr)\n   105 932\n   106 \n   107 If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n   108 resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n   109 \n   110 >>> def clock(f, n=2):\n   111 ...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n   112 ...\n   113 >>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n   114 0.86\n   115 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   116 0.016\n   117 \n   118 If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n   119 not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n   120 \n   121 >>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n   122 0.28\n   123 \n   124 So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n   125 expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n   126 with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n   127 longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n   128 simply applying the transformation itself.\n   129 \n   130 Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n   131 result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n   132 the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n   133 paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n   134 in the following sum:\n   135 \n   136 >>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n   137 ... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n   138 ... cos(y)*cos(z))\n   139 >>> args = expr.args\n   140 \n   141 Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n   142 \n   143 >>> fu(expr)\n   144 3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n   145 \n   146 But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n   147 obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n   148 but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n   149 of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n   150 is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n   151 \n   152 >>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n   153 ...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n   154 sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n   155 \n   156 Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n   157 \n   158 >>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n   159 >>> TR10i(a)\n   160 sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n   161 >>> newa = _\n   162 >>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n   163 sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n   164 >>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n   165 True\n   166 \n   167 Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n   168 final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n   169 better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n   170 \n   171 Notes\n   172 =====\n   173 \n   174 This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n   175 \"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n   176 \n   177 References\n   178 ==========\n   179 \n   180 Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n   181 simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n   182 modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n   183 http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n   184 \n   185 http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n   186 \n   187 \"\"\"\n   188 \n   189 from __future__ import print_function, division\n   190 \n   191 from collections import defaultdict\n   192 \n   193 from sympy.core.add import Add\n   194 from sympy.core.basic import S\n   195 from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n   196 from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n   197 from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n   198 from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n   199 from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n   200 from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n   201 from sympy.core.power import Pow\n   202 from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n   203 from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n   204 from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n   205 from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n   206     cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n   207 from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n   208     cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n   209 from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n   210 from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n   211 from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n   212 from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n   213 from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n   214 \n   215 from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n   216 \n   217 \n   218 #

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\\n\\n  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]\\n\\n  arguments:\\n    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\\n    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.\\n    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\\n    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\\n    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\\n    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\\n    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.
